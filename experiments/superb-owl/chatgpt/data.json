        "msg": "I thought I should make some clarifications while it\u2019s still fresh in my memory what \u201dmind bouncing\u201d refers to. As I was perceiving all the vanishings, I noticed how the subjective point was moving around, or appearing in different locations. The perception, or the conceptualization of the perception, was another quality to observe vanishing. Every time I perceived that, the subjective point moved again (it\u2019s a matter of perspective, I guess, as observing the observer is impossible; cf Mead on \u201dI\u201d and \u201dme\u201d). When I noticed that, the subjective point moved again (for the same reason). I was getting somewhat frustrated about never getting close enough to actually have clarity about the vanishings of these subjective points. In order to take away the distance, I intended to merge with the subjective point instead of observing it, because that\u2019s the only way for it to actually be the subjective point. If I observe a point, it becomes an object. I decided to stop observing and instead become the bouncing. So when the subjective point vanished in order to arise somewhere else, I vanished to. Michael Taft asked me more closely about this, because he thought the bouncing could be a wave rather than something binary. He tried to get clear on how the fruition fitted in with the bouncing. I suggested that maybe it is both a wave and an unstable particle, just like electrones and photons seem to be, depending on whether or not they are observed. Maybe it was a wave for a while (the staccato quality before the fruition) and then became a virtual particle that vanished and then reappeared somewhere else (fruition). This makes me think of a book by Madelene L\u2019Engle that I read as a child (Many waters). I was riding a virtual unicorn just like they were in the book.",

        "msg": "I was at a Shambhala center in Stockholm today. It was supposed to be a whole day meditation program today, but apparently my registration had not been received and nobody else had signed up, so it was cancelled. A woman came there anyway, just in case, so she told me about their activities and their mentoring system and then we sat together for two sessions with a walking meditation inbetween, and it was very nice. I got a half day. She told me about the ungoing investigation of their teacher for sexual harrassments and what a crisis this is for the entire organization. They had taken away his portraits, and now they are having discussions about the leader structure and how to avoid things like this in future. It seems like a constructive process, albeit a tough one. She said that some people had felt devotion to him as a guru, and for those this has been especially tough, and she also said that devotion is part of the problem. As a newcomer I appreciate that she told me this. It felt like a responsible approach. So, now they don\u2019t have a guru. They have separated themselves from him. That\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019m not looking for a guru, but for a context of people doing meditation together. I\u2019ll think about getting a membership, but I\u2019ll at least go there for another whole day sitting in a month (they\u2019ll see to it tha there\u2019s actually a program that day). She also gave me information about a retreat they\u2019ll be having in July. I\u2019ll think about going there. She thought they would be prepared to accomodate to my special diet somehow, so that\u2019s promising. In their tradition, meditation is done with eyes open because they want to be part of the world. That made it possible to see the visual effects of meditative states, which was cool. Sometimes there were waves in the floor. Sometimes the floor was rising and falling with the breath, like it was also breathing. Sometimes the details of the pattern of the floor stood out with exceptional clarity and sort of came out from the floor. The floor pretty much behaved like the murk behind closed eyelids when in a concentrated state. There\u2019s not much of a difference between having eyes closed or open. For a while I got into sort of a hypnanogic state and could hear inner voices talking. They were male voices.",

For some reason, this direction of the process is more difficult for me, but I\u2019m starting to getting into more of a flow.

At the same time, I could also sense that the sensations were there effortlessly independent from any active perceiver. Still, I didn\u2019t know how to turn off this apparatus of attention and conceptualizing. I started out trying to dissolve everything at once, allowing nothing to take any form, and that was hopeless. I probably took the advice too literally. I felt stressed out because there were sounds and other perceptions that stopped before I had any chance to dissolve them. I thought the mission had failed if something stood out as separate enough for me to identify it, haha, so I ended up with the wrong kind of confusion and little clarity with regard to no self. It is if course much easier to do it with one object at a time. Now I do it with the point that causes the most tension. Instead of trying to dissolve it, I just sort of move in there, and the relative dissolution follows. When I do, it is very clear that it can only be an approximation because it is not separate, not clearly demarcated from its context. In this mode, everything is continuity. That is not a contradiction from the fact that everything is impermanent. It is still impermanent. It\u2019s just impossible to single out separate entities and point to when they arise and pass, because all distinctions are constructions. There are no given or natural distinctions.

There were visual and kinesthetic effects of various sorts and there were states where there were little to no sense of a body. I remember an instance of noticing that I did no longer categorize perceptions. They were all just a stream of sensations. No, not sensations either. They were just there. There were no experiencer there to sense them and they no longer had any anchor in space. There were also a number of unknowing events that I believe were all drops into eighth jhana or something similar, because it feels sort of incomplete. There were afterglows, but of a different kind than from a fruition. There were moments when sounds disappeared. The difference was very clear, because one of my cats made a lot of noice (he\u2019s not allowed to go out on his own because he is on medication and tends to stay out for too long). Furthermore, I was sort of sucked out through different chakras, or had parts of me torned out from them. There were several instances of tripping and falling. There were a lot of champagne bubbles being released. There were instances of visual bubbles coming towards me and hitting my face with tactile sensations. There were also a lot of very soft tactile sensations in my face, like gentle brushes from feathers. However, there were also more prickly sensations throughout my body and a lot of lightheadedness and some distortions of my body with aspects of senses being turned inside out. Now I\u2019m so hungry and wish I had some food beside from my lunch box. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to sleep. It\u2019s time to wake up in one and a half hour anyway. EDIT: Maybe one or two of these unknowing events were fruitions after all? I don\u2019t know. Everything feels unusually crisp today. How does one recognize a fruition when departing from formless realms? I know that some of them were not fruitions, becuase they definitely did not feel like it, and the breath was not in synch. The trippings and fallings might have been fruitions, though. There was sort of a cutting of frames between falling and reflecting on the falling, and there was a freshness afterwards.

However, I have come to realize that I wasn\u2019t wrong in the beginning when I thought that I had accessed Jhanas as a child and teenager. Light versions, sure, but definitely Jhanic according to some standards. There seems to be a lot of debate on what qualifies as \u201dreal\u201d Jhana, but I\u2019m not particularly interested in that. I just wanted to understand what it was that I was doing and make sense of it. For instance, I think I have spent time in the formless realms to heal when I have needed the rest from having to be responsive to a world that was overwhelming. That makes sense.

I realized today that the prospect of experiencing that was probably the main reason for my wanting to go through that door. The descriptions of what the self door is about all sound very nice and are good enough reasons for such a wish, and I think I imagined that to be the reason. When it comes down to it, I really wanted that particular experience because it sounded so cool. I realize that it\u2019s very similar to wanting a particular doll because it has the longest hair without really having an idea of why that quality is even important. I also realize that I may need to go through hundreds of fruitions in order to get a decent picture of what it was like, so I\u2019m being unreasonably impatient. And I feel great, so no need to complain. I just want to put it out there, to be honest with myself. Yup, there\u2019s a disappointed three-year-old somewhere in that construct, and that three-year-old wants to have its own face looking back at it in a weird way just because it would probably be cool. Maybe I just want to understand that strange image. It makes me curious. Anyway, I\u2019m beginning to suspect that those many kinesthetic experiences of having all the senses turned inside out, turned towards themselves, are my version of having an image look back at me. In that case, I have actually already had that experience that I\u2019m so eager to have, and it was very cool indeed. So maybe I can actually let this go. Another thought that has been bugging me today is that shamatha and vipassana really have the same relationship to each other as multiplication and division, at least when it comes to certain forms of shamatha. It\u2019s the same process, only from different vantage points. So why all the fuzz about choosing? If one doesn\u2019t understand division, one doesn\u2019t really understand multiplication either, and vice versa. It is possible to apply one of the operations without having learned to apply the other one, sure, but you don\u2019t go about telling people to choose between those two operations. That would be absurd. Sure, Maths books have to choose which one to present first, but it\u2019s always possible to skip ahead and read the chapters parallelly. That\u2019s what I would do. As a matter of fact, I think I did. Linear thinking has never really been my thing. Everything needs to be understood from different directions at the same time in order to be understood.",

        "msg": "After my session with Michael Taft, I did a 70 minutes long climbing up and down the jhanas, trying to notice the shifts. Now I finally know what those curious instances of very noticable and audible breaths are. That\u2019s the shift down to second jhana from third where the airways are tightening and focus increases and sensations get radically more prickly. That\u2019s a very noticable shift between states, but I didn\u2019t understand what it was before. I find it difficult to stay in the very narrow focus of first jhana. Second jhana tends to enfold on its own, and third not long after that. I don\u2019t find the same joy in the first two that I did before. I was surprised, though, how very easy it was to get into them now just by focusing on the breath at the tip of the nose, an exercise that I honestly have found pretty boring. I could very easily find a very small point of the nose to focus on and feel a huge variety of sensations there in terms of pressure and temperature, and the change of state came almost immediately. Soon there was also a big bright spot behind my eyelids. I have yet to learn landmarks pointing out clearly where the shift between first and second jhana occurs. Michael says that the skin feels like silk in third jhana. For me it has been more like cotton candy and pending between prickliness and numbness before, not really stablizing, but lately more finegrained qualities have shown up. I suppose the sensations of being gently brushed by very soft feathers together with that very pleasant calmness is what he is talking about. I wasn\u2019t aware that third jhana could be so gentle. Up til now I have vipassanized it so much that it has been distorted. There are other aspects of third vipassana jhana that I have always enjoyed, though: I always enjoyed that figure-ground shift when the periphery suddenly stood out with clarity whereas the center disappeared. Next landmark for me (before) was when my hands felt as if they were turned backwards, sort of a mirroring and touch of collapsing between subject and object. I guess that was also more of a vipassana landmark. I didn\u2019t experience that now. It was all softness and pleasant calmness. The shift into fourth jhana is pretty clear, I think, because that chrystal clear awareness is precious. I think it\u2019s also there that the breath gets that exceptional lightness and sensitivity. Coming back into third again makes the shift even clearer, because then it goes from crisp clear chrystal to something more... honey like? Sweet but less clear, more dense. Michael talked about climbing down the jhanas in order to uphold concentration when a higher jhana is about to break up. If one climbs down to second jhana, for instance, it is possible to build up more focus. I think my mind does that intuitively, because I recognized it. I found that it was rather easy to climb back up again after a while and I knew that I had already been doing this without realizing it. That\u2019s what makes it possible for me to just happen to meditate for hours and hours. I have been thinking of it as building up bubbliness, because when I aim for a fruition I need that bubbliness. It\u2019s my short word for apparent impermanence and no self. Nothing continuous and nothing solid. Just champagne bubbles building up and popping. Gotta love those bubbles. I tried to focus on space, getting into the first formless realm and learn to distinguish it. I\u2019m not quite sure where the shift occurs from the more spacious qualities of fourth jhana to the realm of space, but I do recognize that there is a shift somewhere. I think I only got into a light version of it this time. Then pretty soon I sensed a shift from space to the noticing of space, so I think I at least had a glimpse of the realm of consciousness. There was a noticable shift in focus, but the difference was subtle. I don\u2019t remember if I visited the realm of nothing and the neither perception nor yet non-perception this time. I know that I have been there before, but I\u2019m not sure about this time. I do remember a sense of not being attracted to any sensations. I vaguely remember the hint of a decision to get out of there because I wanted clarity and felt like I could get stuck in limbo. Maybe I stood in the doorway, hesitating. When I had climbed down from fourth jhana to third I was aiming at second jhana but found myself getting back into fourth. When I finally managed to climb back down again I realized why. I really don\u2019t like second jhana that much anymore. Going into it from higher jhanas, it is barely recognizable. It is too prickly and rough. I was looking for something pleasurable and clear and focused, and second jhana didn\u2019t fit that description. I was adviced to reread the MCTB2 section on the shamatha jhanas and also Culadasa. Will do. I was also adviced to aim for as many different fruitions as possible. Will do that too.",

This time I did not try to do vipassana but just focused on the pleasurable aspects. I let the phenomenology junky rest. I\u2019ve got to admit that this makes the jhana so much deeper and smoother. Third jhana without the vipassana really is soothing. It was probably the kazoo player that created all those weird tensions that I used to experience in third vipassana jhana, or some version of the observer\u2019s paradox. When the guided meditation was over and he started lecturing and answering questions, I wasn\u2019t ready to go back to a conceptualizing mode, so after a while I just turned it off. I continued listening this morning instead. Then I noticed that it had taken me quite a while to even snap out of it enough to pause. I remember that I was very reluctant to move because I was in such a nice place. Jhana really does itself. There is no effort whatsoever. It\u2019s very obvious that there is no doer there. That\u2019s no self right there. Going out of it is an effort. I imagine that at some point staying in it is an effort, too, and eventually one that causes a lot of suffering, because there are neurotransmittors and hormones involved and they are not and endless resource.",

There is a lot that I would like to write down about my experiences today, but that will have to wait until tomorrow (uhm, today, but after I have slept). I made some notes on paper so hopefully I will still remember it. I was very happy to realize that spontaneity is much more accessible to me than I have thought. I think I have blocked it out for many many years (basically since I realized that I\u2019m weird, and long before I realized that weird can be fabulous), and now things are opening up.

        "msg": "Okay, so I\u2019ll try to sum up my experiences from the home practice programs. I\u2019m feeling sluggish today, but it would be nice to get it done. The first program was introduction to spontaneity, with auto think, auto move and auto speek. That\u2019s the part of Shinzen\u2019s teaching that I have honestly thought of as too weird even for me, and at the same time too difficult because of blockages and poor automatization. For some reason I thought \u201dThe heck, why not?\u201d and signed up for it, and I\u2019m glad I did. It turned out not to be so far from me as I thought. It is really the other side of the coin of what I usually do. I have a lot of faith in letting things unfold on their own because the process knows the way, but I tend to do that in a passive and rather submissive \u201dsurrender\u201d kind of way and just explore the experience of it when the bubbliness happens. The spontaneity exercises are a way to shake the bottle a bit, to make things happen. Not by force, but by opening up to it. I need more of that in my life. I realized that I have actually done quite a few things to cultivate this, after all, even though much more is needed. There are other contexts in my life where I do exercises that remind a lot of this. Explorative yoga, workshops about playing with one\u2019s voice, workshops exploring touch, drama (that was too long ago - I miss it!), gatherings for autistic people where stimming (using sensory input for rehabilitation purposes) is socially accepted... And all of it has been helpful, so that\u2019s something to explore more. It turned out that motion really unlocks things for me. I didn\u2019t just auto walk. I had a whole coreography going on. I\u2019m glad nobody was watching, hehe. It started out like flowing stimming motions while walking, not onlike what I usually do in water because I find so much pleasure in the sensations. Then it gradually turned into a weird dance with fractals of the larger motions added as layers, and more variation. Then symbolic motions started to appear on their own, like brushing away layers of me both in rough ways and more subtle ways. Different layers seemed to call for different approaches. Then I got sort of extatic for a while. I had to lie down and rest a bit, but the motions kept going. I found myself drawing in the air, and I could see subtle traces of it in the air. I could even add hints of colors in a way that I could actually see. It was almost like how people describe LSD trips, albeit in a milder version. After these exercises, when I opened up to cover mind space and a global unfixated state appeared, there were not just the usual vague murmurs and occasional spikes of thoughts popping up from the unconscious. It was more like a whole popcorn factory and a vortex of really loud murmurings and flashing images and flashing smells and flashing tastes (the taste of popcorn appeared really often because I made a mental noting of the spikings that were also referred to in the material as \u201dpopcorn thoughts\u201d, and the taste of champagne turned up a lot as well because I was feeling bubbly and had phenomenology thoughts about it going on). One aim of this practice is to cultivate \u201dwisdom activity\u201d with thoughts popping up without a thinker in a way that is creative and deeply insightful. It dawned on me that I have actually had occasional instances of this. I\u2019m thinking especially of that time when I was struggling ridiculously hard to get to equanimity in a way that contradicts the very essence of equanimity. During that time I found myself in a scene where I was trying to climb a glider plane from the ground. The plane was gliding effortlessly and I was using a ridiculous amount of effort trying to get into it, and it was out of reach. That scene was such an obvious analogy that I instantly got the message. The material from the program also includes information on how to work with the global unfixated state to accelarate one\u2019s practice. That seems to be a very tangible way to integrate a vipassana practice in one\u2019s daily life and remain mindful. I can work with that. The second program was about flow/impermanence/anicca and it was elegantly put and great exercises of the kind that I have been doing working with Michael Taft. By that time it was night here in Sweden and I found myself cycling into a mildly dissolution like state which I may still be in, if this isn\u2019t just jet lag. I had to take ADHD medication to stay alert, and then I couldn\u2019t sleep for several hours after the program has ended. So, no new insights from that, due to the state I was in, but I enjoyed the presentations a lot. Also, even though my clarity wasn\u2019t the best, I had myself a nice dip in the flow of consciousness with bubbliness all over the place. I find that soothing and restful.",

        "msg": "This morning: guided meditation on formless realms. It was easy to let go of tensions in the relaxation part in the beginning. I think I went into a light version of third jhana almost directly. It was pleasantly calm with soothing sensations on the skin. I started out focusing on tingling in my lips, and very soon my lips disappeared whereas other parts stood out. In the part of the formless realms, I\u2019m not sure whether I just lost mindfullness in the neither perception nor yet non perception or simply fell asleep. One way or another, clarity was lost. Afterwards I kept feeling dull and sluggish but also bubbly. That\u2019s a weirdly confusing combination, bordering on derealization or depersonalization. I wasn\u2019t worried, though. Been there, done that. It will pass. Did some errands and chores with help from disability support. Kept feeling both sluggish and bubbly and had some trouble finding words. Didn't recognize my neighbors at first when I met them, which is ironic, because one of them has moderate stage dementia and she recognized me. I got a lot of things done, though, so I guess I have been worse off before. 30 minutes fire kasina practice. The red dot was very detailed, but only when I did not look at it directly. If I did that, it disappeared. A variety of versions with halos in different colors. For a while I had a rainbow colored dot. No yellow dot with spiralling tentacles this time, and all phases were shorter than usually. 50 minutes choiceless awareness. Got into formless realms spontaneously. I probably needed the rest. The nothing realm was not pure, but some kinesthetic sensations remained, which caused pressure sensations in my head. It was a relief to let go of sensations entirely, because then the pressure went away. Definitely feels like dissolution.",

        "msg": "This second day of the online retreat I have had a fruition (early evening on April 11th in Swedish time) and constructed a threedimensional model of different ways to fruitions based on the dimensions I have observed so far (very early morning on April 12th in Swedish time). I did not get to meditate that much after the fruition, because I wanted to take part in the Q&A:s and a couple of workshops. It was a Q&A interaction that had helped me resolve my ongoing challenge, resulting in a fruition, and the person who gave me that answer (Eduardo Zambrano) hosted one of the subsequent workshops. And then I got occupied with that model. This wasn\u2019t exactly what I had planned, but I think it\u2019s relevant for my goal of attaining fruition knowledge. The phenomenology junky in me just couldn\u2019t resist it. I will wait a bit before I post my model, in case it\u2019s just rubbish due to jet lag brain. Regardless, it helped me to straighten out some question marks, so I\u2019m pleased. This fruition was the release of an enormous amount of tensions and compulsions that had surfaced and escalated since my last fruition due to stagnation/coagulation of the flow. I don\u2019t know how others would classify the door, but for me subjectively, suffering was a major part of the threshold to it, and it had to do with resistence against the process and against impermanence in particular. Going through the door, on the other hand, was the opposite of suffering. The coming out/back part of it was about letting go and it was amazing - the best afterglow so far. It was the kind of stuff that makes people religious. Mercy. Salvation. And getting there was surprisingly easy once I realized what was needed. I got there doing metta on myself, focusing on making all the different me:s feel safe and welcome. I forgot all about getting rid of painful tensions and getting fruitions. All that mattered in that moment was making all the gestalts feeling safe, because I really wished that for them. It wasn\u2019t the means to an end, just compassion. And so they surprised me by collectively making the jump, trusting that they would be okay. The next thing I knew, there was a shockwave of relief (yup, both shock and relief at the same time) going through my entire system, bringing me back to life totally relaxed and genuinely happy.",

        "msg": "About that fruition: The balance between caring and letting go was very central, and in both directions. I had to let go of control enough to care about the wellbeing of the different Pollys above anything else. That was what made the fruition possible. But at the same time, the multiple Pollys also had to care enough to let go. That letting go was the fruition, and as the result there was relief from suffering. Letting go of control is both about self and impermanence. Self is perhaps most obvious, since being in control is strongly related to the notion of a doer. Time is necessary, though, or else there would be no action, no doing, and no direction. The suffering was related to both compulsion (strongly related to self) and to pain because of stagnation of flow/moving energy in the body (strongly related to impermanence - at two different levels since the contraction-expansion dimension of impermanence also means a fluctuation over time with regard to flow and stillness). Connecting this to the model: I think the fourth dimension would solve a lot of confusion here. Or perhaps more dimensions are needed? The different directions of caring and letting go have to do with a concept of cause and effect, which is dependent on both time (change) and self (separation that creates the possibility of subject and object). Direction seems to be a possible dimension, though. Similarly, with regard to the impermanence door with no self as secondary aspect, I noticed the possibility of two different directions: merging with the subject and merging with the object. Both required time, or otherwise there wouldn't be the dynamic aspect of direction. Time is one possible direction. In order to sense this change I had to experience \u201dbouncing\u201d sensations in my head. They thus had location and direction in space as well. That\u2019s two dimensions of direction. Or no... there are more than one possible direction in space. Space as we know it has three dimensions in itself. Time is added to that. So I guess the concept of expansion and contraction actually adds four dimensions...? Or maybe that\u2019s not the way to do Mathematics on dimensions. i wouldn\u2019t know. I chose the line of education that involved the smalles amount of Maths and Physics. In addition to this, there are also a number of physical and chemical senses. They add diversity as well. Since we know that inner and outer is a very arbitrary boundary and in itself a dimension in the model I\u2019m sketching, the senses might as well be added as dimensions as well. I don\u2019t know how many dimensions this is. In daily life I have a very poor sense of direction and a very poor sense of how my body occupies space, and my visual imagination is also very poor, so I lost count a long time ago. Also, there seems to be differing opinions about how many senses there are. One sence that deals with space has also been suggested, I think? Proprioception? I don\u2019t know how that comes into the picture if the sences and the dimensions of space are put together in the same model. And how does one distinguish between taste and smell? I think I have seen a suggestion of distinguishing between contrast and color in the visual field. Maybe more variables could be added to that. I know that there are more variables in software for dealing with raw data of photos. Colors can be divideinfinitely, I guess. Also, many (?) animals illustrate that vision can be divided between still image and seeing motion, and that brings us back to spacetime again. Regardless of how one looks at it, the possibilities for distinctions are endless and the connections with the rest of it are equally endless, which brings us back to the dimension of separation and unity. Everything just collapses. And expands. Both at the same time. And in the end, that is the same thing. Only there is no end, so \u201din the end\u201d is totally empty. I need a fruition now. Otherwise I might implode. Or explode. Or both at the same time, or neither. WHATEVER. But, no, apathy is not an option either. Well, apparently ot is to some extent, at least empirically, but if drawn to its extreme maybe one actually seizes to exist? Apathy is caring just enough to be able to suffer from not caring. Nihilism is not caring just enough to be able to cause suffering for those who do care, but not not caring enough to vanish from existence. Dependent origination is the only option.",

What they say is true: everything is created from nothing, and that breaks up the perfect order to chaos. Existence is an unbalance. I guess we\u2019ll just have to deal with that. Compulsions of different sorts are defense mechanisms with regard to this imbalance. That\u2019s why symmetry is so central in many tics and in OCD and also why change is so difficult to deal with for many autistic people. I have also noticed that my tics increase with a higher degree of flow in the body. It is resistance with regard to flow.

Actually, I have only had at a maximum 7 fruitions for all this time, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to worry about that just yet. Michael adviced me to try to get as many as possible, and others have as well, and I was a bit stressed out that I wasn\u2019t doing enough of it for a while. But getting this one when I expected it the least - and from just being compassinate towards myself - got me to cool down in that respect. I don\u2019t worry about it anymore (for now, lol). This last fruition was significant for me. It helped to to put a lot in place. It also uncovered a lot of stuff, hence the racing mind. I think I\u2019ll work with that stuff for a while and let it integrate. It laid bare new tensions too, but these are not as involved with compulsion. Rather, they seem to be about stress that I have built up slowly over the years, and I feel ready to work with that at a sensate level and let it go. I found that I could stop the mind racing by using more metta. It really is surprisingly powerful when the timing is right. I remembered the phrase \u201dI bow to the lord of compassion\u201d from Tashi Nyimas dharma talks, and that phrase almost magically gives me peace. No need for fruitions to get peace. I think the point of fruitions is purification. They are not an end in themselves, but a means. So yes, I see the three C:s of them. Very clearly, actually. Still a phenomenology junky, though, and fascinated by the technicalities of them. They are sooooooooo not me. The thought of attaching self to them is absurd. I\u2019m glad I can see that now. Because yes, I can totally see how one cpuld get trapped in it in spite of it being absurd. I did crave them in a very selfconscious way. But when I describe a process where I\u2019m not in charge, that\u2019s not it. That\u2019s trusting that the process knows the way and balances itself.

        "msg": "Crossposting in order to diminish my own confusion: One of the reasons that I appreciate this forum so much is that it is socially accepted and even encouraged to be a phenomenology junky, as it turns out that I am one. Should have seen that one coming, hehe. Anyway, I sometimes find that language is a crude instrument for understanding complex matters, not least because it requires a linear presentation. I often find that I need to think in more than one direction in order to make at least some justice to the objects of my interest. Unfortunately, I lack both the mathematical and the technical skills to visualize how I think. After having gone through a few different doors to fruition I felt that I had to try anyway, because I needed that kind of framework to integrate my experience in a way that made sense to me. Being unable to communicate central aspects of my experience just drives me nuts. Thus I started to put together a tentative model of what the insights were about. The model is based on very little experiential data (7 fruitions, I believe), so it is of course very crude, and I will probably need to change it over time. It's not an attempt to represent any ultimate truth, just my personal attempts at making sense of something that is of course too complex to make sense of. Constructing the model helped me to straighten out some question marks that I had about my journey so far. It would be interesting to get some input from others if possible. Here goes: Imagine a cube. It has three dimensions. The three dimensions are impermanence, emptiness and suffering. All these dimensions are subject to tension between two extremes that only make sence if there is a reference point of some kind and thus polarity. The tension is a force of expansion vs contraction. The tensions of the different dimensions are represented on the cube in such a way that one side of the cube represents one of the extremes of that dimension and the opposite side the other extreme. The six sides of the cube are thus representations of polarized constructions of the three characteristics, two extremes per characteristic. The impermanence polarity is between the expansive extreme of infinite flow a shaken bottle of mineral water on the one hand and the contractive extreme of absolute stillness (stagnation/rigidity/coagulation) on the other hand. The balance point within polarity (which is of course a subjective construction and dependent on scale) is a balanced flow of motion in time and space, with periods of more stillness. Nibbana is the non-polarity option with regard to all dimensions, and the ultimate balance point. \"Ultimate\" shall not be understood in a normative way; change is the nature of life, and there's nothing wrong with that per se. Let us represent this polarity as flow <--> stillness, thus naming one side flow and the opposite side stillness. The emptiness polarity is between the expansive extreme of separation (dividing, making distinctions, analyzing into smaller and smaller parts) on the one hand, where everything is shattered, and the contractive extreme of unity where everything is merged on the other hand. There is an infinity paradox in both those extremes. The separation extreme paradox is explained pretty well in Zenon\u2019s paradox. The unity extreme paradox is that if everything is on one side, there is nothing on the other side, and thus there can be no sides. The balance point is realizing that emptiness and suchness are pretty much the same thing, only dependent on whether it is looked upon from the inside or outside, as Culadasa puts it, which is in itself a paradox dependent on a reference point and thus polarity. (EDIT: The two opposite sides of the cube reflecting this polarity may be named separation and unity. Another options is \u201dI am nothing\u201d vs \u201dI am everything\u201d.) The suffering polarity is between the expansive extreme of craving/clinging on the one hand and the contractive extreme of having no will on the other hand, which in polarity tends to become indifference/apathy when driven too far to that extreme. The balance point within polarity is letting go but still caring. Compassion if you will (and with the realization that dependent origination means that there isn\u2019t really a independent will because that would imply a separate self). Fruitions are sort of a discharge that gives release for the purpose of purification. They tend to bring us closer to the center of the cube where all dimensions are balanced. In the fruition, the polarity between the expansive and the contractive side is gone. Thus there is no experience. When we come back to the polarized mode we also come back to experience. When we do so, we are relatively balanced. The different doors are approximating constructions having to do with what kind of discharge was most apparent to us. If the cube were an actual three dimensional map with real coordinations, it would be possible to pinpoint the exact location with regard to all three dimensions. That is not really the case since all these dimensions are paradoxical because they depend on referent points and scales, but we can still use the idea of it for the purpose of sensemaking. The six sides of the cube are only relative directions, but there is no endpoint. The sides are thus not the doors; they are just these constructed extremes. The eight corners of the cube do not really exist, because that would require that the sides were actually there and that there was finity, that is, something outside of the cube. There isn\u2019t. Thus, the corners are not the doors. In fact, there are no doors. Doors imply that there is something outside. There is nothing but dependent origination. But (once again) for the purpose of sensemaking, it is useful to understand it as if there could be intersections resulting in a center and different sides and corners. The closer one gets to a side or a corner of the cube, the \u201dbigger\u201d release results from the discharge. \u201dBig\u201d refers to the noticability of the change when coming back and thus getting centered in the cube. I would assume that it is at least theoretically possible to get to fruition from any \u201dcoordinate\u201d within this cube. They are all have a relative position with regard to all of the three dimensions, although since there are no endpoints they are more like angles than actual coordinations (I have very little of Maths in my baggage so I\u2019m probably using the words wrong here; please, bear with me). I don\u2019t have enough empirical data to say anything about what \u201dcoordinates\u201d are most common, but I would guess that certain clusters are more common than others, or at least most commonly distinguished and reported. It makes sense to assume that it is common for one dimension to be more dominant than the others, hence the notion of three doors. With enough clarity, it makes sense that it would also be possible to distinguish a secondary aspect of there is one, hence the notion of the six different doors. But in reality there should be an infinite number of doors since there is no endpoint in any direction. For sensemaking purpose, the six door versions relate to the cube in the following way: - The impermanence door with no self as secondary aspect deals primarily with the tension between flow and stillness and has a flavor of either unity (merging) or separation (dividing). Cf the wave-particle model. Everything as continuous flow or everything as vanishings. - The impermanence door with suffering as secondary aspect deals primarily between the tension between flow (change) and stillness and has a flavor of either caring or letting go. Caring enough to taking or welcoming initiatives or being able to let go of craving or clinging. - The no self door with impermanence as secondary aspect deals primarily with the tension between separation and unity and has a flavor of flow or stillness. - The no self door with suffering as secondary aspect deals primarily with the tension between separation and unity and has a flavor of either caring or letting go. - The suffering door with impermanence as secondary aspect deals primarily with pain caused by either too much attraction or too much aversion or apathy and has a flavor of flow (opening up something that had stagnated) or stillness (calming down something that is too speeded). - The suffering door with no self as secondary aspect deals primarily with pain caused by either too much attraction or too much aversion or by apathy and has a flavor of unity (making connections, belonging) or separation (boundaries, integrity). It should be possible to go through a door that is equally dominated by two of the dimensions. It should also be possible to go through a door that is dominated by one dimension and with the other two dimensions equally involved. I suppose it might be also possible to go through a door that is equally much about all three doors. Maybe that\u2019s the ultimate door, to nibbana.",

        "msg": "Right now I\u2019m actually not quite sure what I want to do in my practice. Today was session 9 out of 10 with Michael Taft, and we talked about different options for going forward. I think I\u2019m leaning towards continuing with vipassana as my main practice, but with the seven points of mind training as something to return to regularly to remind myself of what matters and stay sane. I\u2019m not sure, though. Until now there has sort of been a given progression to things. The challenges have presented themselves clearly. Now things feel so... I don\u2019t know... normal? There is still bubbliness, but the bubbles feel so ordinary now. They don\u2019t seem to build up and force themselves through my ears and pores... or maybe they do in a day or two; come to think of it, they did just a few days ago, so I\u2019m probably reading too much into minor subcycles, haha. So yeah, I\u2019m just talking about here and now, at this very moment, but I kind of have the feeling that the process awaits the forming of an intention. I may be wrong, but that\u2019s what it feels like. I have gotten so used to just surrendering to the process that it feels weird to have it wait like this. If I form the intention to move on with the next path, what shall I expect? How messy will it be? How difficult will the dukkha nanas of the next path be? I guess nobody knows. Could I live with not finding that out for myself? Probably not. There are of course other traditions out there as well, and maybe I should keep an open mind for a while. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I should try out different things and see what captures my curiosity the most. I do have an online sangha focusing on Rob Burbea that I feel I have neglected a lot. Maybe I should try focusing on that for a while? I don\u2019t know. I have done a few of the exercises before, and it\u2019s powerful stuff. Much of it involves the energy body, and that resonates with me. But I don\u2019t know. I could go all Shinzen package, too, of cource. That might be the easy way, in a practical sense (not diminishing the practice!), because there are home practice programs and free online events and there are a lot of coaches available. I like most of that practice, I do. It\u2019s just that... I\u2019m not really a package kind of person. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the package per se. It works. There are a lot of good people involved in it, too. It\u2019s a very sane community. I guess I just don\u2019t like boxes. Also, the format for their online courses for self study reminds me too much of marketing ads. Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing. I will definitely take part in more online events and do some home practice programs, but I think I may need to be driven by something else, if that makes any sense. Although, using their framework for deconstructing the \u201douter\u201d world in a Michael Taft way could be an interesting and doable option. That would be a managable combination of familiar and new. It would give me some direction. Going towards subtler and subtler levels of deconstructing self is of course also a direction. It does appeal to me. There are a few other things that I need to check out. One lesson with Michael Taft remains. Then I\u2019m on my own. There are resources, though. I\u2019m not that worried, and it\u2019s good to know that Michael is not worried either.",

I found myself tending to it just because I took pleasure in the doing. There was no sense of \u201dOh, I really should...\u201d Nothing like that. I just enjoyed the sensory experiences of it.

I guess those parts of the awareness will just have to learn for themselves that there is nothing to fear. Hearing is weird. Sometimes it is very clear that the perception of sound differs between the ears, sometimes it is just one stereo mix, and the shift between these modes can be very abrupt. Sometimes hearing doesn\u2019t seem to occur from a subjective point at all. It just is. Sometimes it comes together with an instant activation of all the senses, with the exception of taste most of the times. Like a flash of complete beingness. It is very evidently based on concepts, so it\u2019s not some ultimate beingness, and since people\u2019s perceptions vary a lot, it\u2019s certainly not objective in any way. Yet it\u2019s not subjective in the sense of having a subject, a perceiver. It\u2019s just one variety of the beingness of a phenomenon presenting itself as it is in all its relativeness.

Yup, the baseline varies, of course, and yes, I have also noticed that there is a difference in what I\u2019m able to perceive. What you describe makes a lot of sense to me and explains a great deal. I have even doubted that there were as significant changes as I first thought, because these two different processes sometimes sort of even out. But there is definitely no way that I could have meditated in the laundry room before; of that I\u2019m certain. I didn\u2019t even realize until afterwards what a peculiar idea that was. I just found it convenient since I was doing laundry anyway. As for the mapping, I\u2019m not so sure that I\u2019ll be able to keep track anymore. I don\u2019t get how all the different insight cycles and subcycles and the described jumping up and down between levels correspond with there being four paths. As for connecting with other human beings, I thought I had already gone through significant shifts. Not meditation-related at all (at least not related to any formal practice), but now afterwards I think it may have been insight-related. It did come with the belief that boundaries between people are only an illusion, but most of those changes were more in line with accepting my limitations and communicating them to people. Some were also about daring to be vulnerable. Before that, it was very painful to me too, especially when I was young, so I was very happy with the changes I had made already. I didn\u2019t expect more shifts there. I thought I already fulfilled my potential, given the diagnoses that I have. But yeah, there have been remarkable changes lately. I no longer have any problem with eye contact. I find it easier to forget about me and take in others with my full focus, interest and compassion. I worry less about making a fool of myself (not that I have been so worried about that for the last decade or so, but in some situations I did worry and I did feel awkward and inadequate). I need much less time to prepare myself mentally. People are so much nicer to me now. The practice you describe makes sense. When I was doing noting in the laundry room, I also did something like that with all the different sounds. That was the amazing part. I couldn\u2019t describe it. I must look into that. I find myself being more and more curious about Tibetan Buddhism. When it comes to music, I think that\u2019s the only way I have ever been able to listen to it. Then again, I have always preferred music that is less dense, more spacious, and there has been a very clear limit to how much I have been able to take in. Is there a name to this type of practice? I can see why I would need to watch out for the raising of energy, so I\u2019ll be careful. Now I need to eat something before I have my last coaching session with Michael.",

Later I planned to do a guided body scan as a preparation for shamatha, a 45 minutes long one by Jon Kabat Zinn that I find helps me relax and let go of thoughts. It didn\u2019t go quite as planned. While listening, I almost immediately dropped into first jhana and then into second. Therefore I had trouble listening to the instructions and go through with the body scan. Still, I wasn't able to make the decision to abandon the body scan altogether, wherefore I couldn\u2019t go further to higher jhanas. Instead I dropped in and out of the lower jhanas and went through with the body scan to the best of my ability. Some dreamlike scenes were interspersed with that. When the guided session was over, one of my cats insisted that I was finished too. I kept trying to stay in jhanas, but I could hear that he was about to pee on my things, so after 20 minutes or so I gave up and let him out. I felt overheated anyway, so I guess purifications were involved. Now I have a slight headache. Earlier today I felt that something was happening inside my head. It felt like there was a renovation going on in there, sort of. Yesterday evening I tried to do a body scan without guidance, but that made me fall asleep. Maybe it required too much executive functioning, or maybe I just needed to sleep. The fact that a beloved partner was sleeping peacefully, snuggling up to me, probably contributed substantially. Maybe I should do just a very quick body scan geared towards relaxation before shamatha, and learn to do body scans geared towards vipassana if I want to work with it more systematically.",

        "msg": "I listened to this short dharma talk to set a framing for the practice that followed: https://youtu.be/Ow5qjrSkOjQ Then I did shamatha for about one and a half hour. The talk was about feeding on the breath energy in the sense of making the breath interesting enough to allow absorption. I realized that there is a common notion of energy as a substance that enters the body at the inhale, but that\u2019s not what I experience phenomenologically. I mean, sure, the body feeds on the oxygene, but energetically (?) the outbreath is just as nurturing. Not only does letting go of the air allow for new air to enter the mammalian system, but the letting go is more than that. It\u2019s not just an instrumental thing, but key. Focusing on the joy and spreading it was easy. It was a joy of letting go. This time I was aware of the clinging to physical and seemingly physical sensations, and I noticed that letting go of them made a difference. Letting go of them gave space to lightness and brightness. It wasn\u2019t an entirely linear process, so I could reconfirm that. Letting go was a relief, so it wasn\u2019t that hard to let go of happiness either. Sometimes there was still residual piti in the background, though, so the letting go wasn\u2019t without resistance. There were different degrees of the experiences. For a moment there was the kind of stillness that resembles a completely calm lake with clear water. There was also a notion of deepening of that, with the kind of dropping of agency that I associate with fourth jhana. However, if the different jhanas are like the different colors of a rainbow, I wasn\u2019t distanced enough to discern whether or not the seamless change had reached the point of the next color. At one point I felt that there was a dissolving of the notion of having a body. That didn\u2019t reach completion, and I cannot tell whether that was a subjhana aspect or a possible beginning of immaterial jhanas. At one point there was a pure bright light filling the entire consciousness, or perhaps being it, but that was too vague for me to tell for sure or even place it chronologically. Somewhere around here I lost mindfulness. I wasn\u2019t abruptly spitted out this time, but noticed that I was losing mindfulness. Mindfulness came back, and with it some of the sense of losing agency, but not completely. Something was still clinging, and there was awareness of that. Then I asked the process to show me what I needed to see. After that there was sort a of kinesthetical and very vaguely visual exploration of expansion and contraction, first the expansion/relief from density and then a gradual contraction that was unpleasant but very educational as it illustrated clearly how entangled the contraction is, and how unnecessary as it is just snared by itself and squeezing around itself in so many ways and with so much repetition. I was kind of waiting naively for disentangling to happen afterwards, but the compression and entanglement remained. It felt as if I was held down by it. No surrender could help there. I had to actively let go there. So I did, partly, in snapping out of it and getting up. Apart from a very mild headache, there was nothing there to hold me down for real. But that was just the part about getting back to baseline. The rest of the disentangling is the road ahead, I figure. It\u2019s the work that needs to be done. And that\u2019s a lot of work, undoubtedly. Still, it is possible, because in that giant tangled mess, there was no single real knot or breach. Now, I know that all sorts of stories should be met with uttermost scepticism in the meditative practice. This was not some ultimate truth, but I believe that it was what I need to go forward at this point, immensely simplified and adapted to the limitations of my mind. I\u2019m grateful for it.",

        "msg": "After the last post I went to the yoga studio and did 90 minutes of ashtanga vinyasa yoga, rested for 15 minutes during which I felt healing vibrations, and then an hour of yin yoga. As I laid down to sleep, I listened to dharma talks by Bhante G and dropped into jhana again, and when I looked at the watch, almost three hours had gone by. Over and over again I cycled the four fine material jhanas. The pull to get into the next jhana was very strong. The fourth jhana was more clear and distinct this session. It had that chrystal clear quality and sharp abstract visual mode and relief from agency and that profound peace that I associate with fourth jhana. At one point close to the end of the session, I felt the body dissolving into waves and nothingness, and then it was back, really heavy. I found myself hearing Bhante G again, with words and sentences that I could now comprehend as a whole, not only fragments here and there. I felt the need to adjust my neck. There were thoughts, reflecting upon what had happened. The thoughts included reflections on how much time had passed, that it must have been quite a while. That\u2019s when I knew the session was over. How I have missed the fourth jhana!",

        "msg": "I did shamatha for a couple of hours before going to sleep. I mainly investigated subtle hindrances and what they do to the experience. Swallowing makes the body appear again if it had disappeared, or breaks the spell of first jhana and takes one back to access concentration, or any kind of downshift in-between. The same goes for any form of change in the breath into something less subtle. On the contrary, making the breath more subtle can take one for a ride. It strengthens the pull of the next jhana. Very subtle changes have great impact. I guess this means that if I want to resist the pull and stay where I am, I need to resist the impulse to make the breath more subtle. By being mindful of details like this, one can balance on the verge of different states and climb up and down. That needs to be automatical, since strategic thinking is no longer at play in the jhanas. I had to do this analysis after I had exited the jhanas, but while there was still an afterglow.",

A hindrance was actualized very tangibly right before we both took a 45 minutes timeout to do stuff we needed to do (which in my case was meditation), so the conditions for shamatha were not ideal. Still, at least I got into a not very stable but very reoccurring first jhana. I consider that a success. Luckily the hot date is occupied with other things for several hours today, so there will be time to practice without the physical presence of the source for strong hindrances.

        "msg": "1 h 40 minutes of shamatha on the breath. There was a lot of becoming going on, which is probably related to starting a new relationship. Lots of narrating, lots of mind-racing. Papancha. It is pretty cool to see that with enough time it eventually does calm down. There is a very palpable surrender there, and a marked shift in experience as the pull into jhana no longer has competition from a cacophony of verbal thoughts. That\u2019s quite the kick. Then the nimitta was suddenly very bright for short while. Unfortunately, by that time my ADHD medication was losing its effect and my mammalian body was losing energy because of lack of food. Mindfulness didn\u2019t last very long. Thus I ended the session, or rather found that it had come to an end. Taking medicines and having lunch might be a good idea. I was going to write that at least the mind-racing and narrative rambling had stopped, but I didn\u2019t get to it before I noticed that it was starting again. Maybe I will be more mindful about it, maybe not. There are lots of remaining fetters. It is interesting, though, how starting a new relationship is different after the view of self has dramatically diminished. There were lots of questions of what I want, what I long for, etc., with the emphasis on me as a subject (in his questions), and I really did find it odd to assume that there would be a subject here that was a continuous entity with an independent agenda. I\u2019m in it for the ride as it happens to unfold. I think it might be an amazing ride. Do I crave it? Actually not. Embrace it - yes. Crave it - no. I don\u2019t feel the need to actively shape it in any certain direction, but that doesn\u2019t make me passive. It just happens as it happens. No need to plan for it, other than for the practical purpose of using protection and stuff like that. One might think that individual agency is required for things to happen, but actually not really. When the walls are down, things have a way of happening.",

There was a clear progression from first jhana to second and from second to third. In first jhana there were obvious pleasant sensations from the breath (directly or indirectly, always conceptually linked) dominating the focus. It was energetic. In second jhana things sort of settled down and the bliss was in focus. Happy happy. Fulfillment, no more sensations needed. In third jhana harmony and peace overshadowed the happiness. Happiness was let go of after fulfillment of that. Then mindfulness was lost and there were dream scenes arising and passing. I remember realizing several times that I had been caught up in nonsensical content again and so I let go of it. I don\u2019t remember the content. It disappeared as soon as I let go of it. For some reason the alarm didn\u2019t go off, but when the time I had settled for had passed, the mind knew it. Suddenly there were itchings and other sensations and I felt the need to check what time it was.",

        "msg": "67 minutes of shamatha on the breath. I decided that I wanted to have enough time to let the session end because it was ready to end rather than because there was an alarm, so I set the alarm for 100 minutes with the intentions of breaking whenever I felt ready but at the latest after 100 minutes had gone by. Concentration is growing. I had company; a partner was lying on the bed next to me playing a video game as silently as he could. Today I wasn\u2019t disturbed by it. I very soon went into first jhana. There was a clear progression to second, third and fourth jhana, with fourth being deeper and agency less and intensely focused. Then I think there were very brief small glimpses of the fifth and sixth jhana but probably not quite as pure as they are supposed to be. Maybe they were just sub-aspects of the fourth, I don\u2019t know. I remember a vaste space and realizing that consciousness was in every direction without boundaries, and then booom, strong bright light everywhere, and then back through space to the fourth jhana I know, which was solid in comparison. Then into something new again, until I realized that it wasn\u2019t new. I was going backwards. It was third jhana, but coming from fourth jhana it had a different feeling to it. It was interesting to get to know third jhana from that direction. It felt very clear but more shallow. When I explored that shallowness, I learned that it wasn\u2019t really that shallow. It just felt so in comparison. It was still very deep and calm, but there was a sense of agency in it that wasn\u2019t there in the fourth. It was like being in a deep pool of clear water but being able to see the surface from below. In fourth jhana there was no sense of there being any surface. It was just stillness and clarity. Back in third I had a sense of direction. I knew that I would be going back. It didn\u2019t feel like I was in control of it, but I knew that somewhere down the line the intention to go back to second would occur. I felt a very subtle smile arise. There was happiness among the equanimity. It was subtle, but it was there. I knew that closer to the surface there would be more of that. And then I was in gentle bliss (back to second), with happiness flowing through my body. There was a body there, although the boundaries of it were fuzzy. It was more like a fluctuating field of energy. There was movement, undercurrents. The environment felt noisy but I still felt no need to react on it. I was in such a great place. Why would I bother with that? I lingered for a while because there was no will to go anywhere. Then pleasant feelings of the breath pulled me back into first jhana. Right, the breath, it could feel like that. I had forgotten. Oh, the energy rush from it! I could feel it clearly in my body, tingly and bubbly, and it felt as if I could just get up anytime and tell my partner about it, until I realized that I actually couldn\u2019t. The intention wasn\u2019t there. I lingered in first jhana for a while. I had to wait for intentions to arise. Then the intention to write the log suddenly arose and I found myself acting on it.",

The center of my focus is still blurry, which is rather frustrating to be honest. Trying hard to concentrate on the specific spots made sensations arise in other parts. There was a lot of movement going on behind the face, for instance. Expansions and contractions, and feelings of having things crack open and of having thin silky veils drawn out. By moving the focus back and forth I managed to feel sensations at most spots despite the blurriness. I noted elements. As for yesterday evening... shouldn\u2019t I be able to reach third jhana while in the dukkha nanas? There were some landmarks of third vipassana jhana that I forgot to mention (feelings of being torn), but not third shamatha jhana as I understand it. I find that confusing. Impermanence is rather obvious with regard to attainments, and not self, and suffering because of the clinging and craving, but that\u2019s old news. I was hoping to be able to use jhanas for insight practice, but they are still not reliably accessible. I have ordered books by Shaila Catherine and Leigh Brasington but they haven\u2019t arrived yet. Now I\u2019m not sure how to proceed. I should probably practice patience. In daily life I\u2019m going through some confusion with regard to what I want, apart from meditating. Wordly stuff overwhelms me, and stuff that I used to like feels meaningless or even disgusting. I think disgust was the dominating nana yesterday. Thankfully this is all impermanent and not self. ... Then I read the thread about what people see behind their eyelids, and I was reminded of having neglected that part of my experience for a long time now. I set an alarm for 20 minutes just to check in with it. I didn\u2019t expect much to arise because of the blurred focus. It started out pretty blurry, but that changed. I could distinguish sparks of light, small color dots and rapid shifts, and then color swirls arose, and then statics again. What was most interesting was not visual, though. Focusing on the visual opened up for inner kinesthetics and some extent of nada sound. The kinesthetic sensations were very third vipassana jhanaesque. Apparently third vipassana jhana is much more accessible to me than third shamatha jhana. I like third vipassana jhana so maybe I should switch back to vipassana for a while to explore this further. I\u2019m aware that this may be a symptom of desire for deliverance impatience. Maybe I\u2019m just fooling myself but I\u2019m thinking that maybe I can alternate between vipassana and shamatha and do both regularly without losing too much momentum. Advice is welcome. Anyway, the combination of inner lights, inner sound and inner kinesthetics was very fruitful before. Maybe I should try that for a while. It tends to break apart views of self.",

First there is clarity and then I slip into a dreamy state for a while, with visions, and then I\u2019m drawn into a void - and suddenly there is a cracking sound and I find myself back in my body, wondering what happened. I believe that these instances are short visits in some formless realm that spits me out because I\u2019m not ready for dwelling there longer. This last time I could feel my body disappearing right before the gap. That has happened before, but there have also been many instances that were more fuzzy as to what preceded the gap. There was a minor afterglow, but jhanas have that too. I feel somewhat rebooted, but jhanas have that effect. It\u2019s a different kind of reboot. If they were cessations, which I doubt, they were probably from the previous path. Maybe they were? I really don\u2019t know. I just definitely do not believe thay any of them was a path moment. I did an hour of just letting things happen as they happened. I slipped in and out of different states that I cannot name. Some of these states were jhanic, some not. Among the latter were very realistic dream visions (I have had a lot of them lately). Before I started a serious daily practice I used to listen to guided meditations of a very new agey kind because I enjoyed it. I never really managed to visualize my spiritual guides and stuff like that because I couldn\u2019t visualize faces or details (except for once as a teenager when I saw a blueskinned person with eight arms - that feels very scripted, haha - and once as an adult when there was more of a kinesthetic experience than a visual one). Now I see faces of unknown people in detail. Great detail. They are looking right at me. But as I\u2019m not having discursive thoughts when I do this, I don\u2019t have the words to describe the faces. Now that I have access to words, I don\u2019t have access to the imagery more than for a fraction of a second at a time, and that\u2019s not enough for me to connect the images with the words. Or well... one of them was male-looking with long hair. One looked like a woman, I think. But I studied the faces closely as we were looking into each other's eyes (one face at a time). I know that those faces were as real-looking as in any face to face meeting. Now it is all so fuzzy.",

Like I would just dissolve into a formless gel and be smeared out or even leak out through the floor, or have body parts falling apart and then keep falling through the ground and further on, endlessly. That was one of my greatest fears as a child. I used to have visions of endless gaps of nothingness and it creaped me out back then. But now I\u2019m actually not scared, at least not all parts of me. I have had experiences of both dissolving and falling into a black hole, and there was nothing scary about it.

I wrote a post on this forum that contained the word cradle, and directly after I read a post that contained the word cats. It\u2019s always like that. Even complex ideas arise from combinations of input that happen to coincide. I\u2019m struggling with unskillful thoughts. Parts of me wish I had said things that I was thinking about a person that was very well respected at the time, because they all turned out to be true, and those parts of me (or of not me) cling to being right. It wouldn\u2019t have been right speech, though, and I would probably had said \u201dtold you so\u201d now and that would also be very unskillful. The fact that I\u2019m even telling now that I would have been able to say \u201dtold you so\u201d is unskillful. But damn, the feeling of being right is so tempting. I probably need to see over and over again how it only leads to suffering. It is obvious to me that I have invested a lot of identity work in my intuitions about people. I usually am right, even when I wish I weren\u2019t. That intuition per se is very helpful to have, but the selfing involved in the identity work around it isn\u2019t. It causes pride/conceit, wrong speech, clinging, and probably other defilements as well. Saying those things at that time would probably had done no good anyway. Nobody would have believed me.

I avoided the elements that are designed to force energy upwards through the spine, though, because the energy knows the way perfectly fine on its own, and forcing it when the timing isn\u2019t right only causes inbalances and pain in my experience. So in practice I guess I turned it into medicinal yoga instead. It was very relaxing. Two hours of shamatha starting out with the breath. Initially I was easily distracted, but the reward was immediate every time I managed to return to the breath and stay with it. I felt as if I were floating. There was some minor pain in the beginning but I remember deciding that it was irrelevant, and then I forgot about it. The eyes were relaxed and unfocused. The whole body was relaxed. I think I may have skipped second jhana and gone directly from first to third. There was more equanimity than happiness. There wasn\u2019t much of an I. Discursive thinking fell away.

Then I just breathed and put my trust into the process. \u201dThe process knows the way\u201d, I thought. I either skipped or rushed through first and second jhana. Came into third. Felt how heavy it was in comparison. Then came to the threshold of fourth jhana. I could see impermanence vividly as I peaked into fourth jhana. It was as if the whole reality was flickering. So fast! I took like a tentative step inside. It was even heavier than in the third jhana. I stayed on the threshold. \u201dDense\u201d, I thought. From there I could peak into different jhanas, as if there were multiple doors open. I peaked into the first of those other jhanas outside the arch. There were occasional zaps of static electricity. It was much less dense. I peaked into third jhana too. On the threshold it wasn\u2019t as still as it is in full absorption. It had more of a vipassanaesque touch to it. I recognized my old landmark, \u201dbackward hands\u201d, that is touch feeling itself. As i investigated it further, I could feel that there were layers to it. I could feel the attention moving back and forth between hands and the thighs that they were touching, and moving alongside the whole area of touch. I could feel it as a wave motion or as binary arisings and passings depending on how I used attention/awareness. I could also feel the field of touch as an uninterrupted stream of energy with no boundary between the hands and the thighs, and that enegy stream was what felt itself. Then I tried to peak into fifth jhana. That was harder. I could feel my eyes sort of squinting, but I still felt my body. It was spacey, allright, but I wouldn\u2019t call it formless. Maybe it isn\u2019t possible to balance on the threshold to formless realms without being formed. Maybe really entering the formless realms requires a leap over a wide moat. I didn\u2019t take the leap. I was standing on the threshold trying to focus on unbounded space, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that quality while standing firmly on a threshold. Instead I found myself feeling that static electricity around my head and then a heavy pressure on the third eye. Heavy and dense. I imagined there being no boundary, to let the energy flow through. So it did. Then it trickled down as if on a shield around me. Then there was lightness and vaste spaciousness, but not formless. I felt as if I was floating upwards, hovering over where I had been before. There was less gravity, sort of. I stayed there for a while, enjoying the lightness. Then I sank down again. There was pressure against the third eye. The pressure sank down and filled up the head, made it heavy against my pillow. I was rooted again, through the back of my head. Then I wasn\u2019t. It was lighter again and then heavy and very non-energetic and calm and peaceful (fourth jhana). Then I found myself gradually rising against the surface (third jhana). It was still non-energetic. Sounds were loud again. One of my cats was scratching on the patio door wanting to come in. I thought I would be able to get up and let him in but thought I would allow myself to rise up to the surface gently and gradually. I felt more and more happiness coming back. In second jhana I tried to move my body to get ready to get up from bed (the noice was really loud now as my cat was desperate). It\u2019s like I didn\u2019t know how to. The body wouldn\u2019t move. There wasn\u2019t enough of an intention. Piti came into awareness again and increased. I was in first jhana. After a while I managed to move my toes and then the spell was broken.",

I must stop. I need to see the avoidance in action. It\u2019s not hard, really. I just don\u2019t want to see it. But that \u201dnot wanting\u201d is also just a feeling that happens on its own. It\u2019s not dangerous. I don\u2019t need to let it control me. And the anxiety isn\u2019t dangerous either. It\u2019s basically a contraction of muscles around solar plexus on a sensate level. It doesn\u2019t even hurt. It affects my breathing, but if I change my breathing it works the other way around too. I need to remember that everything is an opportunity to be mindful. Doing stuff that takes a lot of my energy and concentration is not a threat to my practice. They don\u2019t compete. They can strengthen each other. At least if I do Vipassana and stay mindful while going about my daily business. I guess focusing on Shamatha has made it easier to justify putting off things that would require much of me. So that\u2019s part of the dukkha in Shamatha. Sneaky! I cannot let my passion for the dharma be corrupted like that. That\u2019s disrespectful, contraproductive and bad karma. I will not allow it to go on. I guess as I am about to meditate I need to ask my self each time \u201dAm I doing this to avoid doing something else or am I doing it for the sake of doing it?\u201d At least I\u2019m not procrastinating my practice. That\u2019s something. Maybe I can use my practice as a reward to allow myself after I have finished other important tasks. That and using the tasks as a practice too - not instead of the formal practice, of course, but as a complement.",

        "msg": "Oh. Wow. That means a lot coming from you. Thanks! ... I did 75 minutes of well needed Hatha yoga. Because I had so much to do, I putted up meditation till late in the evening (night, actually), but that was definitely not a good idea either. Now when I look back at the practice log, I don\u2019t regret taking the time to meditate so much during the weekend (I didn\u2019t report all of it, because some sessions only resulted in rest). I seem to have needed it to have a breakthrough. I think I need to prioritize my time better in general and take care of my health better so that I don\u2019t have to feel that I should have worked during the weekend to catch up with what I prochrastinated during the week. I need to realize that weekends aren\u2019t magically endless - it just isn\u2019t possible to squeeze in what I should have done during the week days. It would be better to make sure that I don\u2019t neglect my duties during the week and then have the time off to meditate as much as I feel like during the weekend, apart from the daily practice. As the session started, I think I had dropped down to reobservation. There were three different tunes alternating on a high volume in my mind, and thoughts and feelings all over the place despite starting with the Jonang aspiration prayer that is usually good for clearing my mind. I managed to let go of that chaos and of remaining tensions, but then I was low in energy. The stress was what kept me going and without it I was sleepy. I decided to sleep instead of continuing meditation. I hadn\u2019t set any timer and I was too tired to look at the time but I estimated that the minimum of 30 minutes must have passed, so allowed myself to fall asleep. During the day I sometimes could hear a high-pitched vibrating sound while investigating thoughts, feelings and intentions.",

        "msg": "Short sessions of vipassana during the day, together with what Shinzen Young calls microhits (stop on a dime and start on a dime), actually helps with daily tasks. They can be done practically anywhere, anytime. I just took 15 minutes of vipassana because I was overwhelmed by a spinning brain after an intense seminar and with ADHD medication running out of effect. Wow, what an effective tool it is! I would guess that it took me from reobservation (which is basically the stereotype of ADHD) to EQ. When the session started there were impressions and reactions to them everywhere, so fast, so many, so overwhelming. I started with noting but had to switch to direct awareness. Sometimes the kazoo player tried to get on with the show, but the poor guy wasn\u2019t at all in tune or in synch with what was going on, so that was just painful. He kept insisting from time to time so I allowed him to sink into the background. Back there he was pretty harmless. Impressions stopped being overwhelming. Thoughts found their place in the background and I could choose to listen to those that actually had relevance for the investigation at hand. I took interest in a slow wave rhythm in the head. The waves were about four seconds long (longer than the pulse, shorter than the breath) and seemed to involve some form of expansion and contraction, of what I don\u2019t know. The rhythm may or may not be related to that annoying squeeky sound of pressure regulating in my right ear and the coexisting sense of irritation in my left eye, sensations that I have tentatively assumed to indicate tensions due to duality split. I don\u2019t have enough data, but it may be the case that these sensations correlate with the peak of contraction in the wave.",

        "msg": "I did noting on my way to work. It was prompted because I noticed restlessness and craving. The way to my work is a few minutes walking + a few mintes tram ride + another tram for a few minutes + a few minutes walking again. The trams were pretty crowded so most of the time I had to stand up. My ipad\u2019s battery is dead so I need to use a powerbank for it, which is not worth the trouble for such a short ride, and yet I found myself desparate to use it to entertain myself, which is ridiculous really. I noticed that and wondered why I felt the need to flee the moment, so instead I took up noting. There was an instant reward telling me that it was the right decision: the feeling of veils drawn out from behind my face, opening up to emptiness. The noting was busy, so I could tell that I was back in reobservation, the better part of it when meditating is possible and even benefitting from the mind speed. I sort of like that part in spite of the rushes of anxiety heart beating and the earworms and the spinning mind. The three C:s were apparent. I could notice chains of reactions to impressions. Not all reactions were bad. For instance, walking past a bridge to the part of the university building where I used to have my office arose good memories and a feeling of loving my job. That feeling reminded me that the professor I have been working with had thanked me very generously in the acknowledgements of his latest book, which I had seen the day before when he gave me a copy. I noticed that I was anticipating jolts of pain (arthrosis) inbetween the actual pain impulses, which caused unnecessary suffering. That\u2019s no news. However, I also noticed that even the short impulses of pain contained sub-pulses within them, so there is much more space there than what I have realized before. I got lost in content part of the time. There was a girl walking in front of me who was clearly walking in a way that did damage to her knees, hips and lower back. That observation took me by surprise, because not long ago I would never have been able to see that. Apparently all the yoga has worked miracles with my body awareness. That thought arose and triggered vanity but also I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the damage and the pain the faulty walking would cause eventually. I can\u2019t just walk up to a complete stranger and give her lessons about how to walk, so of course I didn\u2019t, but I couldn\u2019t let go of it. For each step she took I kept imagining the pain. Luckily she turned to the left at the bridge, and that\u2019s where good memories were triggered. After noting that chain of reactions I came back to thinking about how I got lost in the imagined pain of a complete stranger. There and then it didn\u2019t seem to matter that much that it wasn\u2019t even my body. That\u2019s a lesson in suffering and not self (the latter because the pain was so obviously mind made, which illustrates how much of our experience is constructed; it is all constructed, of course, but on different levels, and this was a more tangible level of it).",

Weird how dexamphetamine (my prescribed medication) helps with that. Or not so weird, really, since it alerts the part of the brain that selects attention and thereby calms the hyperactive mind.

I was stuck at the counter for one and a half hour and the situation is still not quite solved. After the initial problems were sorted out, they were searching for a lost mattress and it took forever, so I investigated restlessness. As unpleasant as it subjectively feels, the unpleasantness cannot be found in the body as anything else than very brief impulses to do something else. The impulses themselves are not unpleasant. It\u2019s just the thoughts of what one could be doing instead that create suffering, and the stories about consequences of not doing something more useful.

I don\u2019t get the aha-feeling from something being fundamentally restructured, so I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any point to these cessations, if that\u2019s what they are. Still, it feels like they do something, like bending and stretching the weave of reality somewhat. Coming out of them it kind of feels like reality is that \u201dwibbly-wobbly timey-wimey thing\u201d that Doctor Who talks about, but more like a de ja vue than a new thing. They actually make me feel nauseous. Why do they do that? Does it have to do with jumping between paths?",

        "msg": "I forgot to meditate yesterday. That usually never happens to me. Today I lay down to do shamatha for an hour. There was instant jhana and great clarity but suddenly I seemed to forget what I was doing and then there was a short bip sound and a feeling of coming back online and strong presence. Immediacy. I stayed with it and noticed that the wibbly-wobbly feeling afterwards was actually awsome. I felt weightless. Reality felt so... light. I noticed my old meditation landmarks for the post A&P practice passing by on their own. Then I felt as if I was laughing, but not a sound came out. The body didn\u2019t want to move. Then there was a bliss wave of relief. Tears ran from my eyes. At the same time there was a thunderstorm outside, which was pretty cool. When the 60 minutes alarm went off I stayed in bed for a while. It felt as if it could happen again, but then the sense of agency came back and slowly I walked/swayed to the kitchen to tell my partner. I couldn\u2019t find words for it, and my voice didn\u2019t quite obey me, and I was giggling. My partner said that if he didn\u2019t know better he would have thought that I was drunk. Could this be second path? I\u2019m not sure what to believe. The last few days I have been focusing on being mindful about impulses in daily life, to work on my avoidance behavior. It was very challenging at first but the results were great and that led to a great decrease in anxiety and some important work being done. I have no doubt that the avoidance behavior will fight back. I have had temporary success before. Still, I believe that if I keep doing this, it will get easier and easier to get back on track. Today I noticed lots of avoidance impulses that were so obvious and irrational and silly that I could laugh at them. I was in the middle of a task that I enjoyed and found interesting and not too demanding. Yet, at every instance of some part of it being finished, these impulses arose to do something completely different (such as visiting this forum). Some impulses were not even about doing something that I enjoy, but meaningless stuff to pass time (this forum does not belong to that category, of course). Or I would just ramble about random stuff. I noticed it faster and faster and it started to self-liberate. Daily life with executive dysfunction is such a goldmine for vipassana. Still feeling light.",

        "msg": "Meditated for another hour and a half. There were a couple of unknowing events that were unclear. There is some kind of shift in perspective, I think, but I don\u2019t know yet how to put it into words. It\u2019s about discontinuity. Sensations didn\u2019t feel like they were mine or occurred to any continuous entity. I\u2019m trying to figure out exactly how this differs from post SE. Maybe it\u2019s something like this: before, I could feel sensations arise on their own and feel them from inside them, but there was still a notion of an I that took it for granted that it was in the center of the sensations, even though that center couldn\u2019t be pointed out. I knew that there was no center, because I know from my practice leading up to SE that the point that was the subject would dissipate and then a new point would arise and so forth. Yet there was some taken-for-granted assumption that even when the sense of having a body was starting to dissolve and sensations existed in a field of awareness rather than being located on the body, they somehow belonged together. They all happened to the same mind and there was no question about that, even though I could feel like one with the universe and thought that I had experienced dissolving of the self. Now... even with the subjectively felt boundaries of the physical body still remaining, the sensations didn\u2019t have that taken-for-granted connection. It felt weird that all those discontinuous knowings should form a mind. Weird that thoughts arose about how these sensations \u201dshould\u201d be connected but wasn\u2019t. Weird that thoughts arose that aspired to form a whole, as if it were its birthright.",

It arises and passes and cannot be perceived. Thus there is no center in this \u201dme\u201d that things can be happening to. Yet they sort of do. Now: I\u2019m not the one doing it and I\u2019m not the one experiencing it. There isn\u2019t even a continuous it... or I... or one... Then how the hell do I know that it happened? How can there even be an assumed I? Utter confusion. Wherever these questions pop up, how does the questioner have access to what happened on its own to no-one? Who the hell is asking this now? How can infinite meta-levels of these questions arise? My partner said \u201dI may have an answer to that... It\u2019s not to be understood, but just to be taken in.\u201d For a moment I was waiting for him to deliver that profound answer that I wasn\u2019t expected to understand, but just to take in.

He said \u201dNope, wrong meta-level.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it turned out that the big cosmic joke has to do with meta-level-related confusion somehow. *) EDIT: This preceeded SE, to be more precise, but deepening that insight led to SE.",

        "msg": "It sure is. You knew this was happening, didn\u2019t you? You asked about it right before it happened. Not feeling extatic at all, for now anyway. Can\u2019t guarantee anything, but so far this feels like a subtle and calm thing. Last night I could feel endorphins flowing and I enjoyed feeling unsolid again, but it felt so much more... normal... this time. Like the step between solid and unsolid is only illusory anyway and thus no big deal. I did have a color show going on in the room (dark but far from pitch-dark) with my eyes open before I went to sleep. I hear that\u2019s normal for some people, so it doesn\u2019t count as extacy, right? The colors weren\u2019t that bright either. I have seen worse before. Anyway, it was fun playing with it. I (that absurd I that shouldn\u2019t be able to exist) could choose what colors would turn up. Some were almost instant, others took a while to evolve. Red showed up as pink instead. Orange was really tricky. I had to tell yellow to be less greenish, but it did obey. I could decide how the colors should swirl, how fast and in what direction, but one direction of circling was smoother than the other. Then I fell asleep and slept like a baby until one of my cats decided to pee on my stuff right next to me. He does these very recognizable scratching sounds before doing it, so they woke me up. Cats have a tendency to bring one back to earth. I felt very unawakened as I was washing up my stuff in the middle of the night, swearing like a sailor. I was planning on learning to call up different jhanas and nanas more systematically this time. It would be cool to cultivate the same kind of precision that Daniel has, but that may be way beyond what is possible for me. I\u2019ll have to reread that section, because right now I don\u2019t even know how to start. Just letting the universe do its thing whenever it wants to feels so much easier than putting on the controler hat, even though I know that the intensions are beyond control anyway. If I were to learn to \u201dcontrol\u201d the jhanas and nanas, that would only be how it already is. So I guess either it\u2019s in it for me or it isn\u2019t. Whatever I decide to do doesn\u2019t change anything. That actually takes away a lot of pressure. I could just try out of curiosity in order to uncover what outcome is already there. Well, well... There\u2019s no rush. I don\u2019t feel that eager to go through newbie terrain again too soon. I have three books on the jhanas to read and practice. There are occasional subtle clicking or snapping sounds going on inside my head. At least I think they are inside it.",

        "msg": "I had to deal with some stuff today that makes me feel helpless. That would have been less difficult if it mainly concerned myself, but this has to do with my kid's health and wellbeing. I'll need to attend to work-related duties now, in the evening, to compensate for not being able to work during the day. I felt that I needed to maintain my meditation practice, so I squeezed in an 80 minutes long vipassana session just now. I was tempted to interrupt it several times, because thoughts popped up that I was afraid I would forget about, but I didn't want my brain to learn that practice is negotiable so I managed to resist those impulses. So did I learn anything? I don't know really. I guess I at least learned that I can trust my determination. Insightswise... not so much. Well, I confirmed once again that impulses are very temporary, and that overcoming them is just as temporary and thus needs to be done again and again. And that in the midst of that, some respite can arise again and again. I also noticed that there is a lot going on in my awareness, rapidly. Fragmented is a word that comes to my mind when I think of the experience. I noticed a lot of tensions that I could let go of without making it into an effort. Thanks to Michael Taft's guided meditations, I have learned how to leave it to my body to just stop doing the effort of clenching rather than making an effort to unclench. My introspective awareness seems to have developed enough to detect unnecessary effort more often now than before (I'm not sure of the time scale here). I can see how this is related to the three C:s. I'm pretty exhausted now and tempted to procrastinate my work duties. I find it difficult to know when that is Mara speaking and when I really should listen. I have a history of overcompensating for my disability in the past, leading to severe burnout, but I also have a tendency to procrastinate which leads to anxiety and further avoidance rather than real rest. I think some middle ground might be the wise choice here, like deciding a minimum work load before I get to rest. I think that would be the most self-compassionate choice, because then I wouldn't feel like a fraud and cheater but would feel that I can rely on myself. Just deciding that minimum is in itself overwhelming, but I know where to start, so I'll do that. Then I'll decide if I should set a limit in time or in result or if I can rely on my own feeling about it. Maybe I should set a maximum time limit, because I really do need the rest. I'm thinking of this as practice-related as well, in case someone wonders why I'm rambling about my work. I'm trying to rewire my brain in a healthy way.",

I haven\u2019t been that interested in pursuing that because I kind of enjoy not being in control, but maybe it\u2019s not so much about being in control as about training oneself to see through the fabrications of the mind. Obviously, I buy into a lot of crap in my dreams, accepting the weird premises of that reality frame, so I\u2019m probably doing the same thing during the day. This night among other things I was being sexually harassed by a cute but very creepy mini elephant and spent the rest of that dream avoiding it. I kept thinking \"what kind of cruel people would train an animal to come on to humans sexually?!\", but it never once occurred to me that it was a bit strange that mini elephant pets were suddenly a thing without there being a DNA manipulation scandal, or that they were speaking fluent English, albeit mostly sleezy pick-up lines. I wasn't even that surprised that I could suddenly climb buildings and preferred that to using the stairs because it was faster or more convenient or whatever. I remember thinking that I would die if I fell but that didn't scare me.

It started out with distracted thoughts of a creative kind (research-related and meditation-related), because I\u2019d had an inspiring conversation right before that. My mind-speed had increased and the feeling-tone had shifted into something more optimistic. Despite being distracted, clarity was high. The breath was very pleasant and had that subjective quality of smooth flourescent smoke spiralling in and out. I could feel those electric cracklings around my head that I think of as \u201dmana\u201d. I directed my attention back to the breath over and over again. Jhanic qualities arose as the thoughts calmed down. I had a vision of being ready for the A&P and opening up to it, and it filled my heart and made my body shake.

It also seems like this new layer needs quite a lot of purification (taming is the word that comes to my mind; it's like a wild horse or something) before I can do anything useful with it. Fair enough. At least something happens. I like that. I did one and a half hour of tuning into the process, and the breath was pleasant enough but my mind was all over the place. Sometimes it was extatic but certainly not calm and focused. I followed the spinning mind with varying degrees of success. For a while it felt natural to do noting. The labels just popped up on their own. Towards the end it was calmer but not very focused. I knew when the alarm would set off, though. That much awareness was there. At least I feel good, which is rather weird right now. The nada sound is really loud. I'm sleep deprived and have a histamine reaction from eating nuts, but I feel like if someone tossed me on the ground I would bounce up into the air. I think staying grounded is a good idea now.

I realized that it is exactly the kind of map that I have been missing. It answers so many questions! It also confirms what I have started to sketch for myself, about the relationship between some different states and stages. There are more dimensions to it than one map in itself can cover. It also confirms what I have started to realize lately: some perceptual modes that I used to associate with jhana are not inherent qualities to jhanas but rather sensory experiences presenting themselves more closely to what they really are. I have been working with this rather intuitively, but I have been confused from time to time because I really wanted to map it and the maps that I knew of lacked this dimension and thus led me astray with regard to that, whereas being extremely helpful in other respects. Now I understand the different purposes of the maps - this one, the PoI map and the TMI map. This particular map will help me navigate and cover vipassana territory much more systematically. I can't wait to get started! And I have so many other obligations now! Whyyyyyyyy?!?! I highly recommend this episode.

Then I lay down on the yoga mat to relax for a moment before yoga class, and suddenly I was in jhana. I did 75 minutes of vinyasa yoga and then 90 minutes of restorative yoga which is basically reclining in different positions for a longer time while totally relaxing. I noticed how the PoI cycling started over again each time I moved into a new position, from mind and body to A&P verging on dissolution. I could also see progression according to Michael Taft's deconstruction map, from concept level to flow level. Back home I meditated before I went to sleep and had the same kind of development. Cool hos sensations change stepwise in accordance with the maps. Reflecting on Michael's map, it occured to me that the \"portal\" thing I have seen a couple of times when focusing on the visual field with eyes open must be the nondual part where the object subjectively flickers in and out of existence. I also realized that the latest case of fruitions I had followed his map exactly. I was deconstructing the nada sound all the way.",

My entire body was filled with champagne bubbles and it felt as if some liquid was pouring down alongside my face. In the end we sang a mantra for releasing unconscious blockages and being more patient. That made me shiver, and then there was calm. Right now I have much more on my plate than I can really handle, which is very stressful, and previous burnouts have made me sensitive to stress. Yet, yesterday I was almost ridiculously happy for no particular reason. Not very effective, though. This A&P is much more of a trip than a boost in effectiveness. During the night I listened to Michael Taft's latest guided meditation at SF Dharma Collective. Although my mind was trying hard to keep spinning, sensations took over. My face muscled relaxed themselves immediately and the eyes relaxed back into their sockets even before Michael said so. I guess they have learned the drill. I noticed that as soon as I relaxed, it felt as if my body was floating on clouds or levitating. Direct awareness of the body took over but it still felt the attention waves, if that makes any sense. I focused on the nada sound and that focus made things happen to the bodily sensations and the light. When my focus made the sound divide into different tones, something corresponding happened to bodily sensations and lights. It was like they were all the same consciousness. Edited to add: there were some forceful kriyas too, and some really strong piti that made my body shake as if I was having a seizure.",

Then there was a celebration for my brother's kid with other kids there and lots of noice, so I kind of lost track of the nanas. I have fallen back into the same kind of bodily pain that used to be the default mode before I started my daily practice; I tend to do that in dukkha nanas until insight is matured for that path. Thanks to yoga at least now I know how to keep my posture. That helps. I didn't get to do formal meditation until late at night when I was exhausted so after a while I fell asleep, but the third vipassana jhana was available with the kind of direct awareness of the body that its wider focus allows.

Wow, what a relief! I also came to realize for the first time (embarrassingly enough, as that should have been obvious) that the reason that I often mixed up my kid's name with my sibling's name when being upset was not that the situation reminded me of what a tease my sibling was when we were kids, but that I was regressing to the age I was in when I used to fight with my sibling. And now it was much easier to just remember that I'm the adult. I didn't mix up the names now, but the topic came up. Having ADHD, among other things, emotional reactions can happen very fast and show before I get a chance to inhibit the response (that is, the reaction). Being autistic too, controling the tone of my voice has always been difficult. While some autistic people tend to be under-expressive, I'm usually over-expressive, so if I'm mildly irritated or upset, the tone of my voice may indicate that I'm really angry. Repressing or hiding an emotion has never really been an option for me. I always need to find a way of dealing with it. Today's experience was liberating because the emotion just self-liberated as soon as I realized that the person that had the emotion hasn't even existed since decades ago. I totally see why Buddhist meditation + psychoanalysis can be an awsome combo.",

So cool! I have definitely noticed this sort of backlash. I just didn't associate it specifically with dropping out of jhana, but more with a general revolt of the ego against the path. Maybe it was jhana-related, I don't know. Sounds like a great practice anyway. Come to think of it, yeah... Switching to doing more shamatha, I think this did increase for me. I found myself getting cranky when jhanas weren't accessable. It's hard to tell what is cause or effect, though (if such a distinction is even valid). I seem to have a tendency to get cranky in some specific nanas, and more so when I feel stuck in them, and that crankiness and craving certainly doesn't help in accessing jhanas. I have been thinking lately that it is actually the sort of lesson that I need, both to practice equanimity and to clearly see how the mind builds up the constructions and chains that lead to suffering. That instead of getting cranky I should remind myself that it is not necessarily the jhana that brings clarity but the lack of access could bring clarity as well. How I respond or react to that makes things clear that were hidden from my attention.",

        "msg": "I did Michael Taft's guided meditation \"Meditating down the stack\" again. Afterwards, during the Q&A, I fell asleep, so my memory of the session is a bit hazy. It took me a while to be able to develop sensory clarity in the belly region, but after a while, direct awareness took care of it and I could let go of control. I think my third vipassana jhana has more shamatha qualities now compared to before. It is calmer and more peaceful. Maybe I dropped back into the dissolution nana and had a clearer version of it than I'm used to.* That would make sense. I started out with clarity in the periphery whereas the center of my focus tended to disappear into a haze. For a while that made me change my focus several times, albeit within the scope that I had set out, namely breath sensations in the entire body or wherever they appeared. I could easily find breath sensations anywhere in the body and not restricted to the physical body. It felt like the sensations filled an egg-shaped volume including space that transcended the physical body. Something was pouring down alongside its shell and I could feel some of it touch my face. In the end of the session, there was clarity both in the center and in the periphery. *) crossposting from another thread to keep track: I think the term dissolution is confusing if one talks about a specific stage because there is dissolving going on at various points of the path. I always had the nagging feeling that the term dissolution fits better with a separate scale having to do with another dimension of mapping than the PoI map that deals with the chronology of stages in the cycling. It seems to be more about what Michael Taft talks about in his deconstruction map for Vipassana. Dissolution the way Daniel describes it seems to be a different thing, and that phase occurs at that specific place in the sequence of the cycle. I think confusion or brain fog would be a better term for it, at least the way it tends to manifest for me. I have had chrystal clear experiences of stuff dissolving, but rarely in the dissolution nana. My experience of the nana fits quite well with what Daniel describes in his vimeo, though. That nana seems to get less foggy with every new path, though, and I probably started out with more brain fog than average because of my attention deficit (which thankfully is not an awareness deficit). Maybe it will turn out that the feeling of total confusion is really my thoughts dissolving, and maybe I can learn to notice that happening, with remaining clarity. I have experienced that happening at one occasion (dissolving gradually, manifesting gradually, dissolving gradually again, manifesting gradually again, and so on). I think that was a case of a slow A&P that arose from the confusion. I happened while listening to one of Michael Taft's guided meditations, or rather afterwards during the Q&A part.",

I was using Michael Taft's latest guided meditation mainly as a way to masque the snooring from my partner R who was sleeping next to me, but my mind (or whatever it is that does it, if anything) did its own thing instead of actively listening to the guidance. After an hour had passed, there was a bell and then talking. I was listening to what was said but sort of meditating at the same time. But to start from the beginning... I started out with direct awareness. Then I got into that weird state that seems like lucid dreamless sleep. Maybe it is? I don't know. It doesn't have that concentrated focus of the arupa jhanas so I don't think it's any of them. Maybe it's some state that is talked about in non-duality traditions? Some primordial awareness? Maybe it's what Leigh Brasington talks about as the nineth jhana which is pretty much a state of conscious oblivion? Anyway, I had been very tired so I probably needed the rest, especially since I think I have caught a virus or something. There were so many loud outbreaths happening on their own (breathing out toxins, perhaps) that it sounded like I was snooring, and yet I was completely aware. I just couldn't do anything about it because the body did it on its own. After a while I was more alert and found pleasantness to focus on. It felt pretty much like I was having a warm but not too warm bath with some water or foam slowly and smoothly seeping down my face. The calm feeling of being submerged in water was gradually more emphasized whereas the seeping thing was toned down. It was very peaceful and had a neutrality to it that was at the same time accompanied by a pleasant feeling tone. That's where I was at when the bell sounded (or the bowl).",

I was on the verge of fourth vipassana jhana but not quite ready for it on this path. The nada sound grew stronger when I embraced the impermanence and the not self. It was a bit trippy. I tried to deconstruct external sounds. For brief moments the sound was like confetti being thrown around, but it was always interrupted by some new sound that appeared on a conceptual level.

        "msg": "Slightly more than an hour, reclining. Started with getting a feel for what needed to be done, where things needed to be going. I've had to attend to some scary and emotinally charged stuff today that also required much from my poor executive functioning, so I was a bit wired up in the beginning. It felt promising, though, vibrational and with a loud nada sound. Probably full reobservation as the dominating nana, the one that needs most working on even though the meditation session starts with lower nanas. I'm weird in the sense that I actually like reobservation. It makes things happen. That's interesting. I like the work of getting from reobservation to equanimity within the session. It's such a cool contrast when the shift happens. I allowed myself to just do what I felt like without having to be systematic. I focused on getting relaxed, without deciding about shamatha or vipassana, because that felt like the easiest way to get started. I thought that the process would lead the way after that. I felt curious about what it would evolve into. Reflections about this and that came up, temporarily hijacking my attention. Thanks to recent forum discussions, I thought of that not as a nuisance but as things are, not something to run away from. \"Just this\", I thought. \"This is it\". Then I investigated what that felt like, that very moment being all that there is. Not long ago I think I would have panicked and wished I were in a restful and wildly beautiful Scottish landscape. This time I didn't panic. It actually felt pretty good to open up to the moment being all that there is. It both took me into jhana and showed me brief glimpses of a very rich presence to the bright vibrancy of the moment (my mind's conditioning seems to be rather eclectic, so it doesn't care about whether something is Theravadan or non-dual, I suppose; not that Theravadan tradition wouldn't allow for non-dual experiences, as I'm pretty sure that it does, but if I'm mixing up the lingo, that is why). First jhana developed into second jhana, and the note \"rabbit nose\" popped up because of a recent thread where someone described second jhana as having their attention sort of glued to the breath at their nose and to how the breath made it wiggle or something like that. I never thought of it in those wordings before, but it really is a very illustrative description. It felt like nothing could have taken away that firm focus. The brief glimpses of vibrant precense to the moment helped in cultivating the sukha. The happiness quality was stronger than it has been for a while now. I think that would have been helpful in building a firm ground for climbing the jhanic arch, perhaps getting into fourth jhana and equanimity. It felt like there were possibilities for clarity both in the center and in the periphery. I was easily feeling the breath both at the nose tip and in the body as a whole and I was using multiple sensory modes. Then the phone rang. I knew who it was, and I knew that it was about the urgent matter that I have been dealing with today. I had been mentally prepared to have that phone conversation in the evening, so suddenly it was possible to let go of that firm focus. I will get back in once I have had something to eat. Maybe I have missed my great window of opportunity for today, as I'm now more tired, but that's just life. New opportunities will arise. I feel good. Stable and calm, peaceful. Not tired anymore. Hehe, a thought popped up: \"Can it really be this easy?\" I see you, Mara. Well, it can be like this. Just this.",

I don't mind the dukkha nanas, especially not when the cycling is fast enough for things to happen. This is one of the fun parts for me. I did some freefalling and enjoyed the transformation from wired up tensions through melting butter to liquid in weightlessness. For a while there was equanimity with clarity throughout the whole field of awareness but I didn't have the energy to keep up the focus. Thus the easily distracted mind of reobservation arose again and eventually the body said that it was enough for today. It feels really good to stretch and move my legs around in the air, making them feel solid and strong again. This used to make me feel stagnated but now I don't understand why. There is no stagnation. There is just zooming in and zooming out. Now I'm zooming out a bit and experiencing embodiment, or manifestation as body. That's kind of cool. That vibrational flow of ephemeral and transient bips is also this. Right now I can move inbetween with relative ease. I feel healthy. That virus or whatever it was seems to have vanished. The exhaustion is on vacation. Breathing is easy again. The nada sound is loud. It has come to be associated with authenticity for me. Hm, I think accepting that the body felt like manifesting again brought back equanimity. Right. One reaches equanimity by being equanimous. As simple as that and as difficult as that. Ha, now a thought popped up again: \"There must be a catch. It can't be this simple.\" I see you Mara. Yes, it can be exactly like this. Just this.",

        "msg": "Practicing being less of a control freak in daily life. Quite the relief. There was so much dukkha in it that it made me sick. I can find better purposes for that energy. Practiced some very soft and slow yoga now that the virus or whatever it was is finally gone. Tried to be present to the moment. The visual field came alive. Looking forward to meditating when I get home. It is such a relief that some of the perception seems to have been emptied out. I just realized that I haven't felt that horrible tension in hearing for quite some time now, the one that manifested as some pressure changing squeeks in my right ear as if I couldn't decide whether to listen inwards or outwards. The accompanying irritation in my left eye is gone too. They seem to have been replaced by the nada sound, the sound that doesn't assume a hearer. The sound without any location. Even though it has drawn me in before, it still had no location. It drew me out from being located. If it has a location, it is beyond spacetime. Or maybe it is the opposite. It is everywhere, anytime. Or maybe that isn't really the opposite. Or maybe the nada sound has no location because it is the space itself. Yes. That seems to be the construction that resonates the most with my experience. That's typical. Most practitioners seem to describe space in visual terminology, but for me, that becomes very abstract. When I do experience space, it resonates very well with me but it still takes a long time before I realize that it is the same thing as what others are talking about, because for me it translates differently. I wonder if others that practice with the nada sound also have difficulties in visualizing things. Maybe the huge dominance of the visual sense is a western thing? Now I'm at home, curled up next to a warm and purring cat. Happy happy. I can feel the nada sound vibrating in me and around me, filling me up, bathing me, healing me. Maybe the nada sound is how emptiness manifests in spacetime, where it vibrates into existence. Hm, no... There is no emptiness outside spacetime that could vibrate into existence. Emptiness is not an entity. It is the absence of entityness. The absence of essence. The vibration just comes from nowhere, against all odds, just because it can. And that creation manifests as possibilities that come into being and take form, thereby conditioning further creation. The nada sound is the step before that, the opening to what is not yet locked in. A reminder that anything can happen anytime, against all odds. This is merely a construction, one that I may very well laugh at later on, but right now it is a helpful construction. Using the nada sound as a reminder of all that opens something up.",

        "msg": "I'm having a challenging day today, with difficult stuff to handle in daily life and cycling through the entire dark night. I'm grateful that this too shall pass. Earlier today I spent a couple of hours listening to the nada sound. I forgot to report that I did some Tibetan sound healing, I think it was the day before yesterday. I stopped at the mantra RAM because that was where I encountered difficulties in feeling the right feeling, and the overtones didn't come as easily as with the previous mantras. I probably need to work on that mantra. Now I'll meditate and then go to bed. No use trying to do anything more that requires executive functioning today, as I would most likely mess it up. I think I just went from desire for deliverance to reobservation. I know that it sounds weird, but that is quite the relief for me. Reobservation involves some energetic stuff, and that both feels familar and assures me that I didn't just imagine all of it. The mind speed is also something that makes me feel safe. I know that I will need to let go of the attachment to intellectual faculties, but I'm not quite there yet. Thirdly, reobservation kind of takes the lead. It makes things happen on their own. No need for me to be in the driver's seat. If I just surrender to it, it will be fine. I have been feeling a bit like I did when I was about to give birth to my kid, that moment when the head was passing through the pelvis, before the labor started. That was a horrible moment, much worse than the actual delivery. I remember wanting to squeeze my legs together and not letting anything in or out, and just forget about the whole thing - and at the same time I knew that would thankfully be impossible. When the labor finally started, it wasn't so bad. It took care of itself. The body knew what to do and just did it. All I needed to do was letting it. For me, reobservation seems to be that latter part in the analogy.",

I remember rying to just be with the moment as it was, and random images popped up. Very random. It surprised me that all those images could just pop up seemingly from nowhere. Today I woke up in a bad mood. One of my cats woke me up several times during the night and I was cranky and a bit confused. I felt overwhelmed about all the stuff that I have to do. I knew that approach wasn't helpful, so I tried to warm up for the day by listening to teachings by Bhante Gunaratana whom I respect deeply. That made me fall asleep because all the recitations in pali and discussions about concepts took energy that I didn't have. Bhante Gunaratana deserves better than that. I probably needed the extra sleep, though. Then I did some Tibetan sound healing while taking a shower. That practice probably deserves better than my singing in the shower, too, but it did help. In the beginning, the mantras sounded like crap, but soon the tones were clear and harmonic with overtones and my mood was better. Getting out of the shower I was reflecting on my practice and realized that I used to be very content with just sitting for twenty minutes per day without nothing in particular happening. Just allowing myself that space would make me happy. That was a pretty good approach, I thought, and I played with the idea of just starting over. Meditating for the sake of meditating, nothing more, without investing identity in it. Easier said than done. I will probably have to start over again many many times. The ego is persistent. I like the idea, though. I decided to start a sitting vipassana practice again. I can't meditate for as long while sitting as I do in a reclining position, but that's okay. I'll start small. I can build it up gradually and combine it with reclining sessions. Sitting practice is easier to do in the morning than reclining practice as I get sleepy in the morning. I started with only twenty minutes, and it was nice. One of my cats joined me on the mat, resting his head in my lap. I mainly listened to sounds and let them coexist with the nada sound in my awareness. That was soothing. It had a spacious tone to it.",

In this case I didn't realize that old stuff was involved until you mentioned the possibility. It didn't come up on a content level except for those seemingly very random mental images that were not emotionally charged in any way. Therefore I didn't understand why those negative feelings and unskillful reactions to them arose seemingly out of nowhere. Well, not out of nowhere - I have some really tough things to deal with here and now. I just thought I should be able to deal with them in a more mature way, without feeling like a small child on the inside. If it is really the case that old traumas come up in the meditation like that, then it makes much more sense, and I think it's easier to deal with something that makes sense. If these are the patterns from that scared child, then I can have compassion for them and take care of that child, which sort of makes \"me\" an adult again and somwhat less unawakened as I can respond rather than react, or choose to engage with the more constructive patterns that also exist rather than get absorbed in the feelings from the past. Thankyou for your kind words! --- I meditated for 80 minutes, with a quick bathroom break in the middle. My attention was still rather easily hijacked by emotionally charged thoughts about responsibilities and things that can go wrong, but not all the time. As I assumed that I was in the 3C nana, I started out with a very narrow focus, trying to pay attention to all sensations of the breath by the tip of the nose. It soon became clear that my assumption was wrong. When I focused on the tip of the nose, it disappeared wheras other parts of the face and the body as a whole stood out clearly. There was a lot activity going on around the third eye, so I tested to focus on that instead. That made the forehead disappear and instead the tip pf the nose stood out clearly together with other parts of the body. I tried a couple of further focus changes to make sure, and then concluded that I was in fact in the dukkha nanas after all. After a while, there was clarity both in the center and in the periphery, and an equanimous feeling tone appeared. There were moments of intense presence and a feeling of being synchronized. There was a feeling of reality being liquid; retrospectively I think it might be described like it was divided into countless of tiny drops of liquid, each one of them containing the entirety of it. It also had a kaleidoscopic quality to it. I think I was still too firmly anchored to stuff that needs to be worked through for me to merge with that ephemeral quality of reality just yet. This evening I have an ashtanga yoga class and then a meditation class at the yoga studio. I look forward to both. I still have anxiety, so that was a very short visit in the EQ nana. Lots of flow feeling in the body, loud nada sound. The vibrations feel differently from what I\u2019m used to in the dukkha nanas. More spacious, I guess. Less disharmonious. Less aggressive. That confuses me.",

        "msg": "The ashtanga yoga class and the meditation class was exactly what I needed. What a mercy! That teacher has been home to India for a while now so both those classes have been replaced with other classes in the meantime. I knew that I missed this but I didn't realize just how much. Other teachers have held ashtanga classes but they didn't get the energy precisely right the way this teacher does. My ujjayi breath was a bit rusty now so I struggled a bit to get it right. The rhythm of this class requires that I get it right. Otherwise I feel like I'm about to faint. In other classes I can cheat without realizing it. What a difference it makes! The breath and the postures and the flow of the movements and the focused and calm effort to get the asanas right - that's a great lesson in equanimity. I was happy that my proprioception seems to have come back again. I haven't had much of that until I started with the yoga. I'm not kidding. I used to have very little awareness of how my body occupied space. I always bumped into things, dropped things and so on. I have noticed that depending on where I am at in the PoI cycling, my newly found body awareness varies a lot, which can be very frustrating at times. Now it was better again after a challenging phase. Only one other person showed up for the meditation class apart from the teacher (the same teacher as for the ashtanga yoga) and me. She was a complete beginner with exhaustion and chronic pain. We talked a little both before and after the class. It was a great reminder of how it started for me. It made me feel grateful for the practice of meditation and yoga. It has worked miracles for me. The challenges I face in the practice now are nothing compared to how it started. I felt so much compassion for her, and I think I managed to be helpful without pushing anything on her. We sort of had a moment. I think it may have been exactly the meeting both of us needed at that very moment. It also warmed my heart that she really liked the meditation despite the pain she experienced from sitting for an hour. She looked so peaceful after the class. Wow. I loved the sitting. We did some chanting and some pranayama and then sat. No dharma talk. It was a bit similar to Michael Taft's guided meditations, starting with focusing on deep belly breathing and then changing the focus. In this technique one is supposed to focus on the third eye. The teacher modified the instructions to suit a beginner. He told her to watch her thoughts as if they were a film she was watching rather than partaking in them as an actor. He also said not to worry if she got lost in the content, but instead just be happy that she noticed that and then go back to watching the thoughts. That seemed to work very well for her. It is a goid reminder for me as well. That compassionate approach works so much better than being discontent when the mind behaves like a mind. I found a way to effortlessly focus on the third eye: I listen to it. That makes the drichti follow the same direction. Earlier I have focused on the kinesthetic sensations of gazing towards the third eye, but that can sometimes cause tensions to arise. Listening to the nada sound in the third eye gives a more relaxed focus and also a more reliable one. This focus also made sound, light and touch (or whatever one should call experiencing of the body as a discontinuous gathering of countless sensations without clear boundaries rather than a separate entity) come together and synchronize. It was plesant and peaceful. Thoughts did come up, but often there was no need to finish them because they all felt like a dejavue. The idea was already complete without being conceptualized. Sometimes some part of the mind persisted in going back to the thought to conceptualize it, but it never added any nuance, so it calmed down. I allowed some brief metta to be conceptualized, wishing for the woman with chronic pain to be well. After the sitting we did some brief chanting again. My voice had become much clearer from the meditation. Now I feel peaceful. Peace of mind is such an underestimated quality in this society, isn't it? Not that long ago I think I would have thought it to be boring. It really isn't.",

        "msg": "Yesterday evening I listened to different tones within the nada sound until I fell asleep. Today: 45 minutes of Kundalini yoga 30 minutes of gong meditation 15 minutes of pranayama 30 minutes of guided elements practice by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche according to the Tibetan Bon tradition (loved it) 80 minutes of trying to be present with all sensations (challenged by a distracted mind) I have been strongly attached to mind speed, perhaps especially since I suffered from chronic fatigue with brain fog and thus felt that my identity as a researcher was challenged (at the time I still believed that identity was important). Now I'm starting to really see the dukkha of mind speed. The fast mind may be very active but it lacks the clarity of direct awareness. There is no presence. I need to stop clinging to the mind speed. I finally understand why people don't like reobservation. I think I was attached to the very thing that makes most meditators dislike that nana. Maybe it presents itself in a more ordinary way now that I don't suffer from brain fog on a regular basis anymore, or maybe it was like this all the time but I just didn't see it. In the elements' practice I found that it was most difficult for me to relate to the fire element. I know that I have it in me. I have felt it clearly on many occasions. Still, I had a hard time imagining the feeling at this point. It didn't resonate with me. Space was no problem. The nada sound was loud and I felt unsolid and free. The air element presented itself before it was time for it. It just felt natural. Lots of internal movement happened by itself. Movements in space. Like airstreams. I came to think of a collage I made for therapeutic reasons when I was depressed after my dad had killed himself. It contained lots of images of open wide spaces, heights, skye, wind, flying - relief. Water was very relatable too. It has always had an important healing component to me. Lakes, ponds, the ocean, creaks, rivers... Bliss! Unity. Merging. With fire I just couldn't feel it. As for earth, I couldn't feel much of it in me, but I do have a relationship to it. I seek it out to ground myself. I often walk barefoot in the mud to get connected to it, because I need it. I love the smell of it. Its stability feels safe. I hug trees, too, and touch and smell plants. My partner R also represents earth for me. Lots of unsolidness. Empty. Reality as caleidoscopic liquid. Yet also lots of mind ramblings, like a beehive. At one point an image popped up of an old woman with a leach's mouth, like something from a bad horror movie, but I didn't feel scared. I want to meditate more, but I will probably fall asleep as it is getting close to midnight, and I have a yoga class in the morning.",

        "msg": "I had a great sitting now. It made quite a difference to realize that my mind was actually being very cooperative, not just misbehaving. After all, I asked for it to show me what was needed, and it did exactly that. I sat on the cushion for an hour, first 20 minutes of vipassana, then 20 minutes of shamatha, and then 20 minutes of vipassana again. I know that it is common to start with shamatha in order to get focused for vipassana, but my mind had reminded me of what is needed for this brain, especially right now. Shamatha makes me restless when it doesn't get me into jhanas right away. No point in denying that. I have ADHD and will probably never be able to concentrate reliably when the timing isn't exactly right. That is not one of my strengths. Knowing when the timing is right is one of my strengths, on the other hand, at least when I'm not in denial due to wishful thinking, which also happens. And the only way to know when the timing is right is to observe, that is, doing vipassana. I have heard recommendations about doing at least one hour of shamatha per day in order not to lose all the skills that one has built up. That is probably true for the majority, and it may very well be true for me as well, but that instruction still doesn't help me at all. In challenging phases, that just means learned helplessness. Unless a shift comes that gives me a huge attention upgrade, there is no way that my brain is going to stay awake for an hour in a row of tuning into pleasant sensations of the breath or whatever if gratifications are insufficient. It just isn't built for it. It is more helpful to give it a task it can actually succeed with. I can do twenty minutes. That is not a problem. I can probably do twenty minutes several times per day. Especially if I then get to go back to observing again. If I know that I only have to do it for twenty minutes, then I actually enjoy it. If I am to have a regular shamatha practice, it has to be based on getting concentrated quickly and often, not for a long time. Then there will be brief periods of superfocus when I can go on for hours because the concentration is at its peak. That is shamatha the ADHD way. Ha, I can make a speciality out of that. Feel free to remind me of this the next time I try to fool myself into thinking that I can cultivate concentration through hours and hours of useless monkey mind and/or dullness (both are likely outcomes for the ADHD brain). So I started with 20 minutes of noting, a combination of Mahasi Noting, Shinzen style noting and noting of the elements. That was the perfect combo for this brain right now. It went really well. There was great clarity. Loud nada sound. The noting was fast, for me anyway. I'm no mathematician so I have no idea of the average amount of notings per second. It was enough to keep me on track without getting bored. It enabled me to see long chains of dependent origination in its making. Kind of cool. The thoughts have stopped being shy. They probably see the \"observer\" as that weird geek sitting in the corner watching everybody else interact - harmless. I'm quite familiar with being that geek in the corner from growing up. I later found it to be excellent for ethnography and made a career out of it. Anyway, this worked, and that made it possible to focus on shamatha for a while, because now I was already in a good mood. Somehow I must have made it into equanimity again, because I could easily have clarity at the tip of the nose while maintaining awareness of the breath in my whole body. It was quite pleasant. Jhanic factors were there. Absorption wasn't stable, but I got back to my chosen focus point persistently throughout those 20 minutes. It felt great. The breath got that quality of being flourescent and flowy. I've got to admit that it was a bit of relief to get back to noting, though, because after a while... it's kind of same same, been there, done that, worn out that f-ing t-shirt. And now that noting doesn't cause those horribly annoying tensions and squeekings of my right ear, it's fun. I find the mind fascinating to study. Adding the elements also made it more interesting, and I think it has a stabilizing effect on me to be mindful of all of them as they arise and pass away. I'm very content with my posture now. I have tried out so many versions, because I have a history of really bad posture in general. It was just too much to think of at the same time and I couldn't get it automatized and I had very poor knowledge of what is good ergonomically. I still have to do much of it manually, but that is totally compatible with vipassana. That is another reason for starting the session with vipassana, by the way. After twenty minutes, it is at least more automatic than it was in the beginning. Once the posture is exactly right, it is self-maintaining to a big extent. Since I have mainly practiced in a reclining position for a long time now, I thought it would be tougher to start sitting again, but this was not a problem. I wasn't bothered by it. I think I stretched out my neck a bit a couple of times, but no biggie. There was some very subtle pain for a while, but I was fascinated by how impermanent it was. With this posture I won't hurt myself. I did feel some pain when I got out from the position, but that ended very quickly. I made sure to use my core muscles and be careful with all sensitive parts. Sitting up straight like that gave me more energy than reclining does, and I was able to relax as well. Pointing out the three C:s was easy. I used all six senses and all five elements. I'm happy now. And yes, I did note \"pride\". Several times.",

There were just brief instances of minor pain and very brief impulses of restlessness. I kept focusing on noting the whole time, which was only 20 minutes. My leg was numb and it took a while to get rid of that afterwards, but I don't know exactly why the prickling sensations when the circulation comes back feel so horrible. That's empty. That observation took away some of the intensity, which illustrates that there is no essence to it. I think there were more gaps in what was covered by the noting in this session compared to yesterday. I noticed more lack of space than space. I felt contractions around the heart. The clarity and the scope of focus varied fast, which was interesting. I noticed some attachment to the sensations associated with the elements air and space, and dukkha when they passed away. There was asymmetric pain. I had a hard time settling into the posture. The breathing was affected too. So typical lower nanas. I'm considering taking some pain killers but noticing some aversion to that. I think I'll do it anyway, despite being a chicken, which is what one thought says. I really don't think it's a good idea to cultivate macho ideals with regard to meditation. That internalized archetypical working class hero dude thing that I have going on, among others, will have to stand back. Yup, pain killers and my ADHD medication. Then I'll get back in the saddle.",

Started out with vipassana, noting mainly based on Shinzen Young but with aspects of Mahasi noting and noting of elements. For a while words only slowed me down so I skipped them and instead just recognized the sensations. Then I felt that the rapid noting made me restless so I slowed down a bit and instead contacted the sensations more thoroughly. That was pleasant and created flowy sensations with great clarity both in the center and in the periphery. I tried to focus on pleasant sensations of the breath for a while but that made the mind want to pass time thinking about stuff, so I abandoned that attempt and got back to vipassana. There was flow in all senses. Concepts made little sense. There was a feeling of confusion, yet great clarity. It made no sense to distinguish between different sensations or different senses. It was all vibrations or static noise, maybe ones and zeroes popping up and disappearing. Then the nada sound caught my attention. I guess there was a zoom out. The nada sound was loud. I could easily tune into different tones in it. That made something happen. It felt physical. Like pathways opening up, something melting (liquid-ish), expansions and contractions. Some pathways were blocked and started to wobble when I listened there. Maybe it has to do with paranasal cavities and pathways between ears, nose and throat? Maybe the sound is physical vibrations that resonate differently depending on the size of cavities? I could zoom in and out on the sound to get separate tones or something more like white noise. It felt like physical zoomings, covering less space or more space.",

        "msg": "Sat for only 30 minutes because of other obligations (multiple major things both at work and in my private life going on). Allowing myself the time for it in spite of everything around me felt like mercy, because whereas my schedule is cramped, there was space within. Lots of space. Bright space. Sometimes it was bright overall; I don't know how much of that was visual and how much was more a feeling or taste or something. Sometimes bright spots and/or bright swirls clustered together in the center of the visual field. At one point there was a tangible contraction and then expansion of the visual field. It was a bit like when you're on the cinema and the screen gets bigger when the commercials stop and the film is about to begin, only it was first in reverse and then back to widening again. What a weird thing! The contraction was very noticable, and yet it still looked like I could see everything that was there to see. I mean, there was nothing outside of it. That's where the similarity to the cinema screen analogy ends. At the cinema it is possible to see what is around the screen, and the frame around the image projected on the screen when the screen isn't used in full. In the sitting there was no frame outside of which there could be anything. It was the entire visual field. Only somehow more limited. For a second or so. And then back to being spacious again. I think that contracted mode used to be my default mode before, and I think I get back into it in more challenging nanas. I seemed to go through very rapid cycling during that short sitting. There was an A&P moment, too, that was similarly short. Did som zooming in and out on the nada sound and its different tones. During the day I have been cycling very tangibly. The cycling gets especially evident in challenging times, I guess. Amazing how fast one can go between being totally at peace and feeling close to a heart attack and then back to peace again. Speaking of which... I need to get back to working; otherwise there may be no time left for sleep before I need to present the work in the morning.",

The duality feels like the centrifugal force pushing phenomena apart, creating a this and that and a here and there. I can feel it kinesthetically, and I can just stop creating that divide (during meditation; in daily life the shifts between modes still just happen, and duality is still the default mode, except in some activities, I guess). Letting go of the divide allows for the deconstruction to move on instead of being trapped in that tension. I'm not sure deconstruction is an accurate wording.

So that's it. I cannot see myself ever enjoying a good wine again. It's just not worth it. I can live without that sensory pleasure. I can't live disconnected from the source. Today the elements didn't resonate with me for a long time. I couldn't hear the nada sound. I couldn't feel the emptiness. I was wired up and uninspired and out of synch with basically everything. There was a divide between me and the nature here. I had to work hard to reestablish the connection. Tonight I walked barefoot in deep snow and waded barefoot in the lake, surrounded by ice and snow while looking up at the starlit skye. I made sure to contact all the elements in several ways and feel the connection to them deeply. I walked out in the woods by the lake and a creek where the water sounded alive, where there was silent enough and no electrical lights nearby, to really feel the connection to the water, earth, air and space elements. We had a fire inside so that was easier in a way, but I couldn't feel connected to that until after I had connected with the other elements. Out there in the woods, I was suddenly \"online\" again. Colors invaded my visual field and I could hear the nada sound and I could feel the emptiness filling me up again. At the same time, my inspiration returned and I realized what my book chapter should be about. And when I came back to the cottage, I had a connected meditation session. Once again I was able to feel the divide as it arose and let go of it. There was sensory clarity again. I have lost momentum, though, all because some silly attachment to a set of sensory pleasures. No more. I used to think it couldn't be that bad to have a couple of glasses of a good wine a few times per year, but it really shuts doors in a tangible way. Now I know, and I intend to keep those doors open.",

        "msg": "Busy day but I'm glad I squeezed in 30 minutes of formal meditation at lunch time. This was interesting. I started out very openly, just being attentive to what was going on. I noticed that vipassana was most engaging, so I started noting. It was a mix of Shinzen style noting, Mahasi noting, and noting of the elements as associated with modes of being. That made it easier to focus, because it helped me to notice tricks of the mind and stay aware instead of getting swept away by thoughts. All elements were at play. Noting that opened up more space. There were moments of just being present, and the centerlessness lasted a bit longer. When thoughts popped up, it was still clear that there was no center. The thoughts didn't come from any center. They felt disintegrated, sort of. \"I\" was disintegrated. The connection between \"me\" and the thoughts felt very arbitrary. They weren't even really in the same location as any other aspects, or maybe they were but on another plane. It is hard to describe the experience. It was like partly overlapping clusters of happenings or something like that, and on different levels of abstraction. I think I'm not used at having something as abstract and layered as fully conceptualized and verbalized thoughts being part of these moments of subjectively experienced centerlessness and direct awareness. I probably tend to get drawn into the illusory center in time for thoughts on that level to appear normally (I often notice it retrospectively, like \"Wait a minute, that wasn't 'me'!\"), but this time I didn't. I got to non-experience it first-hand, so to speak. It was a bit confusing in a fascinating way. And of course the fascination drew me back into the illusory center, creating an experiencer, but there was a delay there. To clarify, I let go of the noting at times. It was a dynamic thing. I used them when they were readily accessable and used direct awareness when that was readily accessable. Is that the sort of thing that people refer to when they talk about different gears? If so, I think I get why. It really feels like putting in a new gear that fits better with the current mode of driving (although the extent to which there is an illusion of there being a driver varies quite a lot with the different gears). Maybe I'm starting to be somewhat more fluid in changing between gears.",

I have used just sitting as one of my methods from the start, but I think shifting between that and noting took more effort before whereas there is now more flexibility. I guess when you learn how to drive you gradually gain more automatization in changing between gears as well (I don't drive). I think it also took some energy to decide which mode would be most suitable at the moment. I have never been one of those briliant Mahasi style noters. I think that's at least partly due to the way my brain is wired, with both attention deficit and a tendency to sometimes drop into a less verbal and more sensory-based mode of being. Phenomena don't naturally come with a label tagged to them for me. They don't even come with clear boundaries. There are so many different ways to categorize reality, so many different planes, so much overlap. I have never been comfortable with labels. They are so arbitrary! ...which is a very autistic approach. And yet, sometimes I need a method that keeps me from spacing out, which I guess is due to the attention deficit.

        "msg": "Practice yesterday had to be squeezed in on the fly because I was travelling the whole day. I had planned not to fly this year at all, for the sake of environmental concerns, but this was due to an emergency. The experience differed from before. Sensations were much more nuanced. I used to like the sensations during take-off, but now they were mixed in a way that was unfamiliar and slightly unsettling. I noticed some fear that was probably subconscious before. Maybe that's what I used to get a kick from. Kinesthetically the experience was so rich that it was a bit overwhelming. I remembered it as much simpler, just being pressed back into the chair and feeling the force of movement. Now there was so much more going on. It was disparate, several processes at once, multiple laws of nature at play. Emotionally, while there was fear in the body, there was also space and calmness. During the flight I did some chanting of those syllables that I could recall from b\u00f6n sound healing. Because of the noice from the engines, nobody else could hear it anyway. Most of the time I couldn't hear it myself, but I noticed that I knew exactly what tones and overtones came out, because I could feel the sound kinesthetically. I knew the vibrations. I noticed that when there was a sudden pressure change, that affected the overtones so that they came out as disharmonious. Those vibrations felt differently, and that made the sound stand out a bit despite the noice. I played with that for a while, fascinated. Travelling with so many different modes of transportation and having to go through so many procedures while being pressed for time demands a lot from this brain's impaired executive functioning, so it was blatantly obvious how much unawakened reactions are still at play, albeit somewhat less than before. That was valuable. It made priorities clearer. It is necessary to work on the roots of suffering. Attaining jhanas is not. And there's a lot of stuff to work with. Challenging businesses of ordinary life is a goldmine for practice. I was also reading Ken McLeod during the travelling, which contributed to that motivation. There were moments in the midst of finding buses and trains and dragging heavy luggage that I was able to step out of the mammalian mode and feel the space and be present to the sensations of the moment. That was amazing. I want to be able to do that anytime. Late at night I did some formal meditation. I don't know for how long. I did it until I fell asleep and somewhat longer than that as I stayed aware while sleeping for some time. This time the belly sensations became self-aware faster. There was space. There were inner light and nada sound, all vibrating. There was awareness.",

The last few days I haven't written down reflections from my meditation. I'm going through some confusion at the moment and I have a hard time making a story out of it. There have been moments of strong bright presence and stress-related contractions in a weird mix. Today in daily life, details were standing out in an unfamiliar way.

I have been spoiled insofar as I have been able to meditate for hours in a reclining position without getting sleepy or dull before. So instead of feeling sorry for myself I did a sitting meditation, 45 minutes. No nodding, no dreams. Instead some restlessness showed up. I guess I need to work on the hindrances. I thought about the Buddha sitting under that tree and resisting Mara in all shapes. 45 minutes of sitting still is a piece of cake in comparison. I also came to think of the alert sitting position I applied in school in order to keep my brain from falling asleep. I was reminded of that when reading Ken McLeod's book. He talks about the natural straightness of the spine in an alert position, and that made me realize how simple the right posture really is. So. 45 minutes of pretty boring meditation, with nothing really happening, but at least I didn't get dull or fall asleep. Thankyou for motivating me!",

It involves minimal discomfort thanks to the furniture, so it might be a good idea to extend the time. No numbness. Relaxing into the posture was easy. My fingers were positioned in gyan mudra on my thighs/knees and almost immediately they were so relaxed that I couldn\u2019t feel the boundaries between them. It was more like a field of energy. Thanks to the upright position, there was no dullness, except for some very subtle dullness towards the end of the session. No sleepiness. No dreaminess. Some very welcome spaciousness. Some distractive thoughts. For some reason Leonard Cohen was a persistent earworm. Some brief impulses of restlessness. Thinking about the Buddha helped with motivation. The nada sound remained very loud throughout the session. It seems like there is less tension involved in zooming out to cover the whole spectrum of the nada sound than in zooming into separate tones of it. Less contraction, more space. I started out with some noting without a specific meditation object but soon used the nada sound as the object, not in a shamatha way but to cultivate some basic attention as it seems like I need to return to the basics for the moment. There was some aversion to that, which I noted. I noticed som selfing with regard to responsibilities, which led to contractions. There was also some relief in just sitting there. Space. It made breathing easy.",

        "msg": "Something shifted today, thankfully. During the emergency trip I made on December 6th-9th, there were two days when I wasn't able to squeeze in any formal meditation. I tried to pay attention in daily life but reached a limit to my executive functioning which took a lot of the energy that I would otherwise have spent on meditation (formal and informal). That caused a regression. On my way to the yoga studio today I noticed very clearly that the visual field was much more limited and narrow than what I have been used to the last months or so. It felt like tunnel vision but I'm pretty sure it was my \"normal\" vision, the one I used to have. It's a miracle that I haven't yet been run over by a bus or something with such a limited attention in the traffic. Well, there have been many close calls, for sure, but that changed somewhere down the line, as my visual field suddenly widened a lot. Until that breakpoint, people who got to know me very soon developed a reflex of grabbing me to keep me from walking out in front of cars. That stopped. And in the beginning of this trip, I actually got to be the one grabbing my partner who was about to walk out in front of a car (he's not used to British traffic). But then I lost that widened vision at the end of the trip or something, and I lost my equanimity and sense of spaciousness. I was contracted and stressed out and irritable and exhausted from all impressions and decisions and responsibilities and changes and... well, everything. I would probably not have survived what people go through as volunteers in India and stuff like that. My deepest respect for that kind of work! 12 hours of airports and railway stations and subway connections are enough to make me almost cry, especially after dealing with an emergency. Let's just say it was a humbling experience. Since then I have felt that a connection has been lost. Today at yoga class I think it came back again. Sensations knowing themselves came back. I'm so grateful for that. It felt like something was dead, and now it's alive again. And when I came out frome the yoga studio, the visual field was widened again.",

Then I continued for some time, don't know exactly how long. I found that at this point in time, it might be helpful to focus on the breath as it vibrates in the cavities behind the face. There were some jhanic factors but no absorption, as I'm too stressed out by responsibilities in daily life. I need to find a way for my practice not to be in conflict with such responsibilities in times when resources are scarce. I need to find a way to let go of them for the duration of a meditation session at least. It's like I don't trust that I will still remember them. I write them down, but it still feels like they are vanishing from my control. This is probably some version of the ego panicking about not being in charge. Maybe it doesn't trust that the awakened not self will still care? But why wouldn't it? There has never been a separate continuous self to begin with, so why should there be any difference? The things I worry about are stuff that I'm pretty sure will remain important, when I think about it. They involve the wellbeing of my child and the prospect of making a difference for a vulnerable group of people through my research. If anything, awakening and staying awake would most likely enable me to do a better job, as it would set the priorities straight. I need to trust that, both consciously and subconsciously. Okay. That was actually helpful. I think I understand better now why I'm running into difficulties, and that makes it easier to have compassion with it. Hm, I think I have also been procrastinating some responsibilities because of some erroneous subconscious belief that attending to them would require my ego to be in charge, as if there were a real conflict between the path and daily life. Of course that only increases the anxiety What if I were to trust that I can attend to those responsibilities without that old kazoo player? Suddenly the tasks seem more appealing.",

Thus I turned to vipassana, and immediately piti arose again. I embraced impressions from all sensory fields, as widely as I could, and I found it pleasant and exciting. I opened up to the world and let it flow through me. There was fluidity and movement. A thought popped up: zoom in enough and everything gets vibrational, but that is also the case with zooming out. There were flickering in all sensory fields. As I focused on that, the fluidity fell apart. It was all fragmentary. No continuity. No vibrations because nothing was cohesive enough to vibrate. It was more like flakes of ash, dissolving as soon as they appeared, or tiny reflections from a multifaceted prism flashing by and disappearing - but without any prism there to actually reflect, unless \"I\" was the prism. I probably somehow constructed that kind of implied center even though I was under the impression that I didn't. It felt like I just let everything fall apart to the extent it wanted, in accordance with some natural entropy. It felt confusing at first, then more like relief, but still with a taste of confusion and a sense of having the world slip away from me (aha - there's the implied center).

I remembered that being in the center of the experience is only a delusion, and it helped a little, although I kept thinking that I felt utterly motivated to get rid of the remaining delusion, because the dukkha was obvious. I won't bother any readers with details of the sensations, but I remember being surprised and relieved that the sensory level, as horrible as it was, still wasn't quite as bad as the story I could have made up about it and partly did. I noticed how I was prolonging the pain by reliving it in my memory, so I just stopped. Thanks to that, I was able to clean the floor and the walls and all the things that were in the line of fire without puking again (by the way, any advice on how to remove blueberry juice vomit from a linoleum carpet is most welcome). The moments just before actually vomiting was horrible, though, and very unawakened. My body tends to overreact to the prospect of puking, so it sends out \"code red alert\" signals all over the place. If there is some form of awakening that would enable me not to feel in the center of that, I want it. I'm certainly not there yet. Sorry for the inconvenience caused by reading this.

Then, after noticing that, I lay down on my bed to continue in a reclining position. I started out just taking in all sensory experience without focusing on anything in particular. Piti arose immediately. Amazing how much more pleasant the world is on a sensory level than when one engages in abstractions (that is, as content rather than as sensations of their own). I noticed that a doer/controler arose, trying to direct attention to this and that to cover all the senses and all directions, and it was sort of amusing to just notice that. Instead of trying to control the controler, I just let it do its moves. There was sort of a pendulous movement to how that manifested. In one end there was closeness to a sense of all this just happening on its own, knowing itself. In the other end, that observation created a watcher. The same pendulous movement occurred on the meta levels of it as well. Parallelly to this, I think I was rapidly cycling between A&P, reobservation and equanimity (the latter mainly in brief whiffs). I recognized this. I have done it a lot before. I think I didn't always realize how rapid the cycling was and therefore mixed up some of the characteristics of the different nanas. I have often had the feeling that I really enjoy reobservation for some strange reason, but I think I mainly enjoy the dynamics of rapid cycling between extremes with regard to different dimensions. It is fascinating. It's creation in its making. I'm intrigued by how energy is released and consumed in the shifts between these stages and how this makes things happen. There really isn't that much of a distance between A&P and equanimity or A&P and reobservation as one might think looking at the maps, and as contrasting as reobservation and equanimity might seem, somehow there is a very subtly gliding scale inbetween them. It seems to be possible to balance on the threshold inbetween all three of them, as if there's a wormhole junction there. I think I have spent quite a lot of my meditation time there, surfing on that threshold. This investigation triggered a story factory in my mind. I let it be and took notes. Old stories about different archetypical personas in my psyche (constructions from about a decade ago) came to my mind and I saw them in a new light. I had started out with two basic personas, one of which was reactive (like a vulcano, sort of Kali-like) and one who was extremely non-reactive (I'm simplifying now because I don't want to get into all the details on this content level). There was an intricate interplay between these two personas. Both of them were equally necessary for survival. One of them tended to oscillate between A&P and reobservation (very ADHD), the other one between dissolution and equanimity (autistic). Then I had built on them with additional archetypes to map the whole dynamic, including the more grounding persona who kept it all balanced and the spacey one who in crisis put all the others in cryo pods and set the autopilot of the spaceship in motion (until the eruptive persona woke up and burned it all down to create something new). Seeing how these old stories manifested now, in the session, made me realize that without any knowledge of the dharma, I had mapped the dynamics between the different nanas and between the five elements, based on empirical observations many years ago. All of it was there in those stories. It was comical how much of it was there even literally. Part of me was eager to stop meditating to write all this down. It feared that it would all slip away. Other parts noted that reaction and did not give into it. There was a pendulous movement inbetween these modes as well, and \"I\" observed it. It was interesting to notice how the frustration was building up and then sort of balanced itself as the tip of the wave reached a certain tipping point and collapsed into calmness, and how new ripples would build up a new wave, over and over again, and how there were meta levels to this as well. As I investigated this process, every meta level of investigation would generate the impulse to stop meditating and write it down. I recognized this as well. I knew that of one ignores these impulses, they will eventually calm down. My best technique for dealing with procrastination, which is basically an avoidance issue, is to resist ten impulses of \"jag ska bara...\" - a well known phrase from a popular series of books for small children in Sweden. It translates to \"I'm just gonna...\". The first few impulses of \"I'm just gonna\" tend to revolve around very basic cravings and aversions, like checking if there's something interesting on the TV (I haven't watched regular TV for several years, but you get the picture). The next few impulses tend to be telling someone (or all readers on social media) about the miracle that I managed to resist those first impulses (I have quite a few facebook friends who would understand the miracle very well since they struggle with procrastination as well, and on this forum it is possible to get into very intellectual discussions on the details of the phenomenology of resisting cravings and aversions). Thus I said to myself \"ain't gonna happen\". Well, at least not during the meditation session; now it obviously happens, but that's another story. (I could tell you about what further sorts of impulses tend to arise following that method, but that would be getting too much into the content of a side story.) It was interesting to see how different chunks of stories were triggered by certain other chunks, with variations but according to a distinct pattern, and how it all was expanding and contracting, in pendulous movements, and how all these pendulous movements each were one end of another pendulous movement, and how it all had meta levels and just kept going. And how this seems to occur on all levels of aggregations. That's life. Wheel of samsara, sure, but also very creative. Literally and metaphorically.",

Opening up to meditation felt awsome. Sensations were alive. It was probably far from as pristine as it is for arahants, but it was my version of direct awareness and a great relief. I rested in that for quite some time. It was probably the disgust nana that had led to it, and I got the hunch that the disgust nana is something I need in order to let go enough of both the daily life control freak and the overly excited phenomenology narrator to actually get some real meditation happening. I think it also provides enough distance to keep me grounded through desire for deliverance and reobservation. I'm starting to think that many of my most educating and interesting meditation experiences have probably been during the dukkha nanas. I just haven't always realized that because I have been enjoying it so much. Then I got the bad idea that I should dwell in the disgust nana and amplify it to learn as much from it as possible. That was probably not the smartest thing to do so soon after the penicilline incident spraypainting my entire kitchen. Nothing like that this time, though. Just a feeling. But gee, do I feel sick... Amplifying disgust... of all ideas. I think I may be a bit too caught up in it to be able to not assume being in the center of it. I know that it will pass, though, and parts of (not)me know that it is not self and understands how it turns into suffering. Writing this helps. The deluded center is at least partly dissolving. Cool. Wow, that's a relief. Emptiness is sort of taking jurisdiction. Touch sensations living their own life. Nada sound. Space. Lightness. It is soon time to get my laundry from the laundry room. The thought of that was followed by a contraction as there were imagings of the smells and noices there, and the suffering arose. As I noticed it, it disappeared, and there was space again. Okay. Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all. I think it generated some insight. I can adjust the volume of aspects of nanas to learn from the reactions to them. Maybe I'm very slowly making some progress with regard to technical approaches to the nanas, just like I wanted to do after second path (which I assume is where I am at, but that could of course be wrong).",

I was getting caught up in the content although they were rather nonsensinl\u00e4gg and dreamlike, but I noticed getting caught up in them and saw the thoughts as thoughts and as not mine. The thoughts were multisensorial. There was a sense of movement. Things cracked open behind my face. I'd guess that has something to do with hormones or neurotransmittors or glands - something physical that is affected by the meditation. There was a sense of spaciousness. I associate that with emptiness/anatta. The nada sound, which was very subtle in the beginning of the session, increased its volume. There was a sense of energies moving around, causing shivering. Somehow thoughts popped up about past situations that I wish I could have handled differently. I could see how my actions contributed to harm. There was grief. There was also compassion. I could see that I wasn't able to handle those situations differently at those points in time. I could acknowledge that conditions are different now. Spaciousness remained. I couldn't detect any contractions because of the difficult thoughts. Then there was subtle energetic stuff going on again. Towards the end of the session I was a bit restless which caused some contraction. I didn't want to risk getting late for yoga class.",

I found very hands-on instructions in A Study Guide for Right Practice of the Three Trainings \u2013 Phra Thepyanmongkold which is available as en e-book free of charge. I happen to have a clay tray that is perfect for the purpose (it is actually a form that came with a frozen dessert). Its back side is smooth and red-brown unglazed earthenware. The size is a bit small according to the instructions, but I think it will do just fine. I was a bit surprised that looking at a clay tray could make me feel so good. I had to work through some hindrances first. According to the instructions, looking at the object is not supposed to involve shimmering and changes in the image. Since it did, I had to find a way not to be distracted by it while not being annoyed by it. When I did, I felt so good. I also had to work my way through dullness, which was interesting as it became very clear what an illusion it is. Sometimes I had a hard time seeing the tray because purple swirls blocked the view. I had to work past that as well. For a while I couldn't see the tray because there was nothing there in the visual field. It was like a hole of nothingness in the pillow against which the tray was leaning. Since this was supposed to be shamatha, not vipassana, I had to get my mind to realize that it should continue to project an image of the tray even though there was no new visual information. According to the instructions, the learning image is something very different from the after image that shows the opposite color (which looked like a solar eclipse sometimes and like a blue disc sometimes). It is supposed to look just like the tray (and that is just the learning image, the initial step!). I have very poor visualization skills, so I had to look at the tray most of the time. Toward the end of the session, I noticed that I could see the image perfectly for a very short while before the after image took over, so I played with that for a while, back and forth. I found it very cool. The tray was really there, visually. I could really see it, vividly, just not much longer than a second. The instructions said that one should do this hundreds or thousands of times to get a learning image, so I trust that even this non-visual brain will learn over time. I found this very educational. I also liked the sense of stability and nourishment that came with working with the earth element. The nada sound became stronger while doing the kasina. I also periodically felt sensations reminding of static electricity crackling at the back of my head. I could feel that there was a cycling of nanas. Sometimes I went through different types of vibrations associated with the dukkha nanas. I don't know how long I sat. I estimate that it was about an hour.",

        "msg": "This morning I went to a Kundalini yoga class. The teacher, who I think came from India, seemed to know what she was doing. Her instructions were thorough and the exercises were well balanced. We did a set called kriya of alleviation. One thing surprised me: the teacher kept saying that if there was pain, one should breath more forcefully. That is very true for muscle pain, but not for Kundalini-related headaches. Thankfully I know the difference. How can it be so common for Kundalini yoga teachers not to know about common Kundalini phenomena? A couple of the breathing exercises were a bit too strong for me so I had to breathe very carefully and avoid pushing it. Thanks to that caution, the headache that I could feel building up didn't stick but went away. There was plenty of energy anyway, so I had no difficulties whatsoever to feel the vibrations. I mean, I feel vibrations like that basically every day. Our whole existence is vibratory. I'd rather work on my clarity than forcing more vibrations on something that is already vibrating perfectly fine. I think many of the Kundalini yoga exercises help with the clarity, but some of them seem to be designed to push people into the A&P with force, and I don't need the force. I expect from someone who teaches Kundalini yoga not to need the force either, and above all I expect them to know that it is important to be sensitive to when pushing may be beneficial and when it might be a better idea to be more gentle. Otherwise some of the exercises can be harmful. How can they not know that?",

Focusing on the earth element while preparing a meal felt good. It gave me piti while keeping me grounded at the same time. Wow! That was... physical.

The kasina object stood out and naturally drew attention. There were moments of... I don't know how to describe it accurately... simplicity? After the half hour had gone by, it was time to prepare more ingredients. I did so while maintaining focus (not visually on the kasina object, but on the earth element). Then I sat down for another 15 minutes of kasina. After those minutes had passed, I thanked the kasina object for being there when I need it, enfolded it in a warm scarf (in earth colors), asked it to rest, regenerate and take of itself, and put it in my bed. It was an impulse. Then I ate the nutritious meal with devotation.

The fact that I was really tired most likely contributed. I was too tired to construct complex stuff. On my way to yoga class late in the afternoon I tried to tune into that mode again, but trying got in the way of actually doing it, or rather not doing it. As Adya says, it's not about what you do, but what you do not do. It did create some interesting sensations, though. That, in turn, made me think about review phases for some reason, and the sensations related to them. Soon enough, a ticking sound and kinesthetic sensations of ticking arose in my head, just like in late review phase. It seems like those particular sensations were called up. As I lay down to relax before the yoga class started, my body immediately dissolved into a field of fine-grained sensations that occurred on their own, like an energy field. Late at night I did 45 minutes of earth kasina, but I had to pause the timer after half an hour to drink some water, because it felt like my mouth was dry like a dessert. I guess I was a bit too susceptible to suggestion. Yesterday I moisturized the clay tray for it to remind me more of fertile soil than of a dessert, but tonight I had skipped that part. I'm still so thirsty, despite having ingested large amounts of water. Visualization was scarce today. It seems like things want to dissolve rather than stay solid. There were some dullness and phases of harsh vibrations, but also phases when the kasina object seemed to solidify and get a smoother surface.",

I can play that it's me, and I can stop playing it. Like trying out costumes, except there isn't a stable actor there to begin with. And it doesn't mean being unauthentic, because it's all there. It all resonates on some level. This also means that it's very silly to cling to an emotion. It's just a pattern hovering there. It has no substance of its own, but it doesn't really go anywhere either.

In daily life I noticed that I could improve my balance instantly by tuning into the earth element, and so I did some balance exercises while cutting vegetables.

The color of mud around here has the wrong color according to the instructions, and I think that makes it a more difficult kasina object. It's greyish brown and rather dark. Yet, the counter image was black rather than bright, so I guess I'm going through dukkha nanas. That fits my broader experience as well, as I'm more contracted that I would like to be, which is in itself a contracted feature (craving and aversion, and yes, I noted it). I observed a cycling going on between a narrow focus and a more panoramic one. There was also a cycling of brainwave patterns, I assume, with phases of hypnagogic purple swirls, sometimes accompanied by a seductive sleepiness. Directly after such a phase there was often a heightened awareness together with panoramic vision, sometimes also a feeling of simplicity although not as profound as before but rather just a hint. That never lasted long. The first time the clarity and panoramic vision appeared, it came together with a click inside the skull. One advantage of the mud kasina object compared to the backside of the clay tray is that it doesn't make me feel thirsty and dried out. It feels more lush. It is after all real soil, probably with some life in it. Still, in the long run, I think I'll stick to the clay. There was low grade piti.",

        "msg": "Yesterday I think I may have gone through dissolution territory. In meditation I sort of balanced on the threshold to sleep. Dreams are a bigger challenge to awareness than sleep per se. Thus I found myself aware during sleep but had my attention hijacked by dreamy stuff while awake. There wasn't much clarity, but some dissolving seemed to be going on. There were instances in daily life where I noticed restlessness or wanting the now to be different. When I noticed that, I reminded myself that the now is all we have, and made an effort to tune into it. That gave a sense of space and allowed for a more diverse experience. Definitely not pure bliss or anything like that, but some perspective at least, and a general sense of okayness, I guess. Today I noticed anxiety. First I was convinced that the body tried to tell me that it desperately needed something, but then I investigated the feeling more closely and couldn't find any substance. There was just this sense of intense discomfort and wanting to get away from it, and the sense of wanting to get away from wanting to get away. I figured that I was darknighting and allowed the space for feeling whatever I was feeling. As I didn't want to feel what I was feeling, I accepted the feeling of wanting to get away from it and allowed myself to fully feel that. Somehow I catched up with the paradox, and that gave relief. I'm sitting on a delayed train. I used it as an opportunity for meditation. I did three guided meditations with Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. The last one led to two clickings inside my head, somewhat similar to the surge of static electricity (the \"poof\") that sometimes arises when some electronic equipment is plugged in. I wonder if that's what fruitions of a previous path feel like. It felt like I was suddenly back online, but there was no big deal. Just some minor relief and a feeling of being done for the session but not for the path. I used to find it very difficult to just tune into spacious awareness and whatever is suggested in non-dual teachings, but it is gradually getting more available. I think part of it may be that I'm somewhat more patient. It doesn't have to be intense. Subtle is fine too. That subtle difference in sensations when I tune into spaciousness or tune into the firmness of a rock. That's kind of cool. Apparently I'm no longer afraid of the sudden sounds from fireworks. No need to cover my ears and get all tense and anxious. None at all.",

        "msg": "I'll try. It might just be speculations, though, because I wasn't focused enough to stay attentive even to that. Comparing it to Mara seems fitting, because it seems like something is doing anything to prevent awareness of what is going on. The \"tactics\" vary, so there is no way to tell whether it will be drowsiness that takes away the focus or narrative thoughts that engage or something else. If I decide to focus on something in particular, I'll forget it. If I decide not to focus on anything, I suddenly find that I'm focusing on something. If I accept and allow that focus, then suddenly I forget about that focus. Sometimes I get so dull that I can't remember whether or not I had decided anything at all. Sometimes I struggle not to fall asleep, but then when the session is over and I decide to take a nap, there is no way that I could fall asleep. I suppose this has to do with the notion of control. I really want to just let go of the illusion of control, and intellectually I understand that there is nothing \"I\" can \"do\" in order for that to happen, but sometimes there is frustration because it doesn't happen \"fast enough\", which is of course a grasping for control. I can see why it for many meditators is effective to occupy their minds with something rather useless while the real process happens on its own thanks to their not interfering with it, as they were occupied with this other task. Unfortunately, I get bored with such tasks very quickly (selfing noted). Today, after my previous post, there have also been very obvious physical contractions. Cramps in my feet, my right hand almost literally grasping in the air. My jaws can't seem to find a natural resting position. Typical 3C nana stuff. Parts of me want to just watch netflix until this is over, but other parts find that utterly meaningless. It is time to sleep now, but although I think there is pretty much tiredness going on, there seems to be other stuff going on as well, keeping the body agitated (not very much, but enough to prevent sleep, it seems, or maybe that's just a story - I don't know).

        "msg": "I had a very pleasant 30 minutes sitting while waiting for the laundry room to be available. I started out with noting, a mixture of Shinzen style noting and Mahasi noting, and after a while there was just noticing without labels. There was space and lightness and \"movement\" and flickering. I once again noticed how hearing often doesn't reach me as raw sense data but as whole packages that also involve several other senses. When the sounds reach me they have already been lumped together with other sensations and layers of concepts. It's not that I first hear a sound and then have a mental image and kinesthetic imagining of it. It is all there at the same time. It has been preprocessed before it reaches attention. When sensations are less conceptualized, with fewer levels to it, they still often reach me as a package involving multiple senses. It seems like the cognitive processing uses multiple sensory modalities. Thoughts are often a mischmasch of diffuse sensory information too. It doesn't seem to matter which senses are used on this less conceptualized level. It's just information that is being organized spatially and in time. It is all relational. It means something only because of how it is organized/distributed. There were many showers of piti, of the freeflowing kind. At one time, after piti had made an upward movement, it made a downward movement as well. It felt like it evened things out, dissolved tensions and made things settle down. This was especially clear in the head and face region, where the movement lingered a bit longer, but it was a whole body thing. It took away those vibrations that were disharmonious. It came together with a kinesthetic notion of disentangling. I had that special feeling that I have often wondered about earlier in my life, the one that I couldn't place although it seemed so familiar, the one that I named \"having the center inside myself\" (before knowing anything about the dharma). Lots of nada sound.",

        "msg": "Sure. Piti is the kind of rapture that is required for absorption into the first jhana, although it isn't in itself sufficient for absorption to occur. It can take many shapes, such as tingles, shivers, champagne bubbles, surges of energy (often upwardmoving), and so on. It is basically the same thing as kundalini, although the latter word is often used mainly for the more intense experiences (since the stories around kundalini awakening differ from the stories around jhanas). The nada sound is the sound of silence, which paradoxically enough can be very loud and consists of a variety of tones depending on how you zoom in or out. I associate the nada sound with being in touch with the process. If I can't hear it, it usually means that I'm contracted, dull, and too invested in stuff. I have made a habit of listening to it in daily life. Sometimes I focus on it in my formal practice. At one time, that gave me multiple fruitions.",

        "msg": "Meditation notes Tuesday January 7th, 2020 A&P yesterday evening and during the night, felt almost like I didn\u2019t need any sleep. My mind was so fast. I felt speeded and was happy, a little bit too happy for it to be balanced. Woke up tired and really cold and with decreased clarity. Dissolution. Dealt with that in a constructive way. Warmed up both body and mind with gentle compassion. Luckily I had planned the procedure in detail during the night. I figured I might as well do that as I couldn\u2019t sleep early anyway. Good plan. Fear manifested as job related anxiety and a bit of avoidance behavior. Procrastination. At that time I didn\u2019t think of it as the fear nana. I just noticed the anxiety. I guess misery may have been the part when I felt lousy for failing to get on with my work plan according to the schedule that I had made so thoroughly, with planned breaks with stuff that would give me more energy and everything. Then I actually went on and did it, later than planned but according to my plan in other respects. That made me feel somewhat better for a while and I got some work done. Then a feeling of sickness started to sneak up on me. I started to worry about what was wrong. I provisionally concluded that it was because I was late to cook lunch (I was too busy working, once I had gotten started). One of my medications tends to make me feel sick until I have something to eat. So I cooked lunch while listening to Adyashanti, according to my plan. It was a great talk about stuff that I have often found myself struggling with (arguing with what is and what was). It made a lot of sense and I thought it was very helpful. Yet, the feeling of sickness increased, and I realized that it wasn\u2019t just hunger and side effects from medicines, but actually spiritually related discomfort. I felt like lying down in a fetal position under blankets in the comfort of my bed which is basically my safe place. I noted that but went on with the cooking and listening. After all, I wasn\u2019t really sick, and it\u2019s not like it would hurt me to listen to Adya and cook food. I ate the food and finished listening. The next task on my to do list was to take a walk to get some air and light (the sun sets early here in Sweden this time of the year, so it\u2019s important not to waste the daylight) while listening to a dhamma talk. I really didn\u2019t feel like it. I wanted to lie down and meditate instead. That felt like it might be avoidance behavior, so I decided to stick to the plan in spite of the discomfort. I thought I could at least take a short walk, listening to a very short dhamma talk. I ended up walking for about 20 minutes, listening to two short dhamma talks on youtube. Towards the end of the walk I recognized that I was feeling pretty much exactly like I described in this recent post: This made it very clear to me that I was cycling through the dukkha nanas, and I took comfort in remembering how quickly that feeling passed away the last time. Also, I named it: disgust. Now lots of thoughts about the maps showed up and I found myself engaging in narratives about the greatness of the maps and about strategies for working with the maps. Classical desire for deliverance. It sort of overlapped with the disgust, though, because I still felt sick. I cringed and felt like crawling out of my skin. I went back inside and lay down to meditate. I submerged myself in the sensory experiences of the feeling. The sickness part of it passed away, or rather stopped arising. There was a great sense of relief. At first I thought \u201dequanimity already?!\u201d Then I realized that there was still aversion to the disgust. There was dread that it might come back and a gratefulness for every moment that it didn\u2019t come back. Overlapping with the passing away of feeling sick came a sense of non-agency (but still a lingering sense of an I with the absence of agency, if that makes any sense), a sudden broadening of the sensory field, and a more direct awareness with great richness especielly in touch sensations. Tactile sensations took over and I was so grateful that the process stepped in and took charge. I could just surrender. It wasn\u2019t even subtle. It was almost as fierce as it used to be right before stream entry. The notion of fierce grace is very to the point. I guess one has to be slightly masochistically disposed to love this, but I really do. I love reobservation, at least when it does this. I just totally surrendered to it and lay down relaxed while reobservation was massaging me with frenzy. I wanted it to tear me apart. I enjoyed it wholeheartedly. Parallelly with that, there was also storytelling going on about what happened. The mind was fast. It wanted to keep track of every detail, and in doing so, it distanced itself from the now. Classical. I thought hey, this is so typical reobservation. Thankfully, awareness was perfectly capable of being aware on its own. It started to calm down, and instead there was peace and a ticking noice in my head. I remembered that ticking from the late review and thought that I had probably sneaked back into the equanimity from a previous path. I didn\u2019t want that. I wanted more reobservation. The ticking stopped and instead there was some energetic activity around my head. I don\u2019t remember the exact order of occurrings. In one of the reobservation phases, either before or after that EQ interlude, it felt like not only my face and body were being torn and stretched out, but consciousness itself, or whatever word is most appropriate. People talk about expanding consciousness, and this felt like it, but not like a unidirectional once and for all thing, but more like it was an elastic rubber blob that was being stretched out in different directions simultaneously and drawing itself back into its original form, back and forth. It calmed down again. I just rested in awareness. There were clicks (2? 3?) in my head and a feeling of restarting. No clear door moments as far as I can remember now (about 1 h 20 minutes after it happened; writing this report seems to take forever). After the last click I could feel my right hand moving on its own. Not in a jerky way like in the usual kriyas, but slowly and with precision. It was gripping and releasing its grip. It felt like some magnetic force was driving its motion. I didn\u2019t feel like I had anything to do with it. It was like something else was taking control of my hand, testing its function in order to learn how to drive it from a distance. Weird but pretty cool. I guess that\u2019s the mind trying to figure out how to interpret the insight that it really isn\u2019t in charge. I got the feeling that nothing more would come out of this particular meditation session, and as I needed a bathroom break and was eager to write all this down, I ended the session. It was about 40 minutes long (from the moment I lay down to meditate).",

        "msg": "Yoga class never went better with this body. The less of \"me\" that was involved in it, the better it went. It was a bit back and forth in that regard. Sometimes the body just moved on its own with astonishing precision and smoothness and swiftness. I'm used to telling the story about almost completely lacking automaticity because of being autistic. I remember examples of that very vividly. It seems like the lack of automaticity is connected to identification processes that cause the person to go about things manually, using or trying to use conceptualization. With less identification, suddenly automaticity is in place. Wow. I just had a bug fix that gave me automaticity, something that my brain is hardwired to lack. Of course, this is something that has happened gradually, but I think these fruitions (if they were fruitions) constituted a rather distinct upgrade bringing it to a new level. Note: I still think there are advantages to the autistic more manual way of functioning as well as drawbacks. I wouldn't want to go all neurotypical. Having access to both modes is favorable, though. Note 2: There are also many instances when autistic people tend to conceptualize much less than neurotypical people. The differences go both ways. I entered jhana automatically as soon as I relaxed for a moment, before the yoga and in the relaxation parts. In the meditation part, there were a couple of micro-clicks/blips or something that reminded of it. In one pranayama exercise, we did a hummungbird sound. There were distinct overtones. That may have been the first time that happened me with a closed mouth. In exercises to really align the chakras into one straight line, it was clearly noticable that a correct position was accompanied by electrical tinglings at the crown chakra. What a convenient tell! Oh, and when the session began, it was evident that it started from the A&P. The visual field flickered like crazy. I could chose to see it either as very rapid arisings and passings of single points or as wave movements. The instructions flickered in and out of existance as well. Or rather, I think they zoomed in and out with regard to conceptualization. Somehow I still understood them. At least I think so. Or maybe I just missed unessential parts of it, I don't know. I'm not claiming a path moment. That's too soon to tell. It may as well have been fruitions from an earlier path, with some additional bug fixes or additional elimination of faulty code that should have already been removed but somehow got back online due to some erroneus back-up system. I do think that I'm at the post 8th junction point, though. That could mean review, but I also know that it is possible to get there before reaching path. That has already happened to me both before SE and before what I assume was second path. Thus I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be the case again. Regardless, this feels good.",

Then misery. Wow, that was contracted like... stagnation, almost. Very compact, very slow. Then disgust, and that surprised me a bit. It felt like something sort of turned inside out and bent around, forming a vortex-like thing. It was thin rather than compact but bent around itself. It was edgy and racy. When I tuned into desire for deliverance, first there was sort of a rhythmic ticking sound, like when you are focused on the second hand of a watch, waiting impatiently for the bell to ring. Then there was contraction with an increasing intensity, like the pushing when you are in labor but don't seem to get anywhere because the contractions aren't strong enough. As for reobservation, it was there instantly before I even got a chance to summon it after the thought popped up. At first it scared me, because it felt like I/reality would either explode or implode or both. There was an impulse to stop it. Then I remembered that I actually love it, so I surrendered. What a ride! It was awsome! It just went whoooosh. There was like a giant pressure wave that made everything sort of shift around and then, after possibly a tiny moment of complete silence and possibly a cut out frame (not sure), come back so much wider and with intense showers of bliss (I guess that could be a case of A&P rather than the real thing). The shift around was a bit weird. Things intensified and then there was a great relief consisting of... well... like a vortex with an additional dimension added to it? It didn't just turn things around. It turned around itself from the inside and out. Then it was all back to normal. I wasn't sure that I had actually gone through equanimity, so I tried to call it up. It was a bit tricky. The motivation to stay focused wasn't there all the way. I had to go through dukkha nanas a couple of times, I think, because as soon as I got to EQ, or even before, I sort of lost interest. Eventually it settled. I got a bit dreamy, and then whoosh. A small whoosh. Very small. It was like it said \"Okay, okay, will you stop nagging already? There, there.\" And then, after the tiny whoosh, there was a tiny click. Very anticlimax. --- When I read through this, I cannot but wonder how the phenomenology of disgust can be so similar to the phenomenology of what was possibly conformity knowledge (or at least a really good A&P experience) and yet feel so very differently. It seems like the difference lies pretty much in the attitude to it. --- The session took slightly more than one hour.",

My current very tentative hypothesis is that this is second path, and that what I previously assumed was second path was really just a call-up of the previous review, or an A&P experience. I could never identify any new conformity knowledge for that set of cessations. This can\u2019t be third path. There is too much assumed agency remaining at the baseline. I think I screwed up the first time in review by racing forward and therefore needed to go back. Not sure about anything, though. It is possible that I had an A&P experience yesterday. I had trouble sleeping afterwards, and before I went to sleep (many hours after whatever occurred), there was heat in my lower back. I had some kundalini shakings. I guess this could be anything from the A&P after stream entry to the A&P after second path. Really don\u2019t know. What I do know is that it was a step forward. Something new happened, and I look forward to further developments. Regardless of whether it was an A&P experience or conformity knowledge and a set of fruitions, it was a not-self related experience. Actually, I think it won't hurt to stay very open to this being just the A&P after stream entry. It's not like being sceptical and cautious would undo anything. There are tinglings at the back of my head. There is nada sound. Breathing is easy. I'm tired. I feel like jhanas may be accessable but for some reason I don't really care about it. There is space.

It is all too easy to be fooled by the clicks that my ears make from coming back into a mode of letting in outer sounds. I'm certain that I had occurrings of the latter kind just now. I also had one instance of sort of a moaning breath sound that I could feel in the throat. It was before I retained the ability to distinguish between breathing in and breathing out. I'm sleep deprived and have a pain (widely spread muscle inflammation, or so it appears) that is possibly energetically induced. I think I may have done something foolish. I recently resolved to have what I needed to awaken rather than what I wanted, with the caveat that I'd be able to take it constructively. Maybe I should have been more precise. I can take a lot, and I guess being constructive is a very relative thing. I think I also added something about for it to allow me to see what kept me from fully awakening. The pain makes the selfing very very clear. I guess I should be thankful, but to be honest, I think I'm more thankful that the combination of paracetamol, holy basil, antihistamines and a histamine 2 receptor blocker together with resting in awareness (or whatever it is I'm doing) reduces the pain, and that there seems to be no real physical damage or illness that I need to worry about. There were instances of hypnagogic dream scenes, with awareness. A woman's face. A wordfeud image that was very vivid and sharp. Reading a reply in this thread (none that exists and then realizing that my eyes were closed and I was lying down next to one of my cats in my bed; I think this may have been the first one, the one that made the rest of them lucid). There were also instances of light, most of them widespread like strong sunlight but one smaller and centered, like a candle flame but whiter. I saw it very clearly but knew that the seeing was mental. It didn't last long. I don't think I completely lost consciousness in this \"session\" (more a necessity than a deliberate formal meditation session). I think I was either in lucid or semi-lucid sleep or gliding into formless realms. Another clicking sound seems to come from deep inside the skull where the brain is located. Its spatial position clearly differs from the clickings of the ears and the clickings from paranasal cavities. I had one just now, while thinking verbally about what to write, so it seems very unlikely that it should be a blip in consciousness. I wonder what it is. Maybe some activity in a gland? The pain is gone for now, and so is the heat in those areas.",

That really made it much easier to notice their place in the breath cycle. The result is inconsistent: some are followed by a deep inbreath, others be a fierce outbreath. No more instances of possible conformity knowledge have been discerned, so I'm sceptical. Just now, after another hour (slightly longer) of just resting in awareness, there was a sudden deep inbreath. I don't know if there was a blip before it, but it was not like when one feels that the breath gets lighter and lighter and then can't resist grasping for air. It was more sudden than that. I was surprised by it. Directly after it, there was another instance of my right hand sort of trying to do things on its own without any sense of agency. I guess it could be just an ordinary kriya. There was no precision this time. I have had kriyas before with fingers lifting themselves, even in this session, so that could very well be what it was. The difference is that this wasn't sudden and spasmodic. It really felt like intentional impulses to test runt the motor skills of the hand, just not my intentions, if that makes any sense, but if so, the test run was less productive this time. There is energetic activation at the back of my head, and the nada sound is really loud. Earlier in the session there were those instances of ticking inside the head. Definitely not in the ears or nose. I wonder what that is. Maybe it's like a loose connection in the brain's wiring, with almost-cessations? Maybe it's just some pressure changes in cavities? Maybe it's microscopic energy surges that one can sense sometimes when one is in tune with awareness? Like spiking gamma waves? I'll have to confess I don't know what I'm talking about here.

It was cool. But today I feel like I'm stuck somewhere again. I think that if there were any cessations among these recent experiences, they must have been from a previous path. It's quite possible that I have never gotten any further than to the lower nanas after SE, but that I have unconsciously kept calling up that previous path over and over again. If so, it was probably a good thing, because I still have lots to learn. I just hope that this will proceed forward. It is also possible that I did get to second path before. After all, there was more of a typical review phase there, with steady access to jhanas for a time period. However, I did make a resolution to get back into review because it seemed to stop to soon, and it wasn't until after that resolution I had such a clear review phase that time around, so when I thought that I called up the second review, it is very possible that it was the first and only one I called up. Jeeze, these things really are messy. Anyway, I feel like this time around, I got a glimpse of some new digging before I presumably called up a previous path again. I think that's what makes me doubt that I even got to second path. I was reminded of what it could be like, being drawn into third vipassana jhana and being torn to pieces, almost, and I haven't had that for quite a while. Not with that intensity. I have missed that. I have had the nagging feeling that things have been too easy and too shallow and too elusive for quite some time now. I still don't doubt that stream entry was real, because that came with lasting changes, and the meditation after that was like a whole buffet of all previous highlights unfolding automatically one after the other and with additional twists to them. There is no way I could doubt that. Things were was easier with a teacher. I think a teacher would have me focus more on one practice more systematically rather than playing around like I do.",

It is comforting that it happened to you too, even though that is no guarantee that it isn't warranted in my case (yeah, views creating suffering - noted, including the view that there is a \"case\"). Sometimes I think that I'm fearing that I'm losing my mind, and then there is a whole cacafony in there debating who said that and whether losing one's mind is a good thing or a bad thing or even a thing in the first place, and taking notes on the storytelling that goes on and the suffering it creates. Then the thought pops up that I'm really losing my mind, and then the debate takes on new meta layers.

Then I laugh at myself, and then there's a voice that says \"People must think I'm losing my mind, laughing to myself in public like this\" and another one moans \"Here we go again\", and then Joni Mitchell's singing gets stuck in my brain: \"and the seasons, they go around and round\", probably at least partly as an attempt to cover the noise from the voices that go on in the background, debating further meta aspects. Is that normal too? I bet it is. I have seen similar reports in other threads, come to think of it. (For every meta level there is also always a voice that pops up to question the ableistic wording and reminds me of the suffering that is created by storylines using mental illness as a pejorative, which leads to further meta levels around judging, and further to debates distinguishing the dhamma on not arguing with what is from nihilism, which reminds me of my ten years of darknighting before starting my practice... lots of analysis of how world views lead to suffering there, and yet that is also new levels of storytelling.)",

        "msg": "At least this makes it very clear that I'm darknighting, and I notice some kind of perverse satisfaction with that, because that means that it's at least going somewhere, which is connected to the view that meditation should be going somewhere (--> suffering). I close my eyes for a while to feel into it, and I can feel the vibrations and the pulse of it, and the satisfaction is there again because it is consistent, which is connected to the view that reality and maps, both inbetween themselves and inbetween each other, should be consistent (--> suffering). A thought pops up that I wonder to what length I would go just to maintain those views, and I suspect that I'm probably going much further than I would like to admit. I also once again notice how much I take pleasure in those sensations, and another thought pops up that I wonder how much of it is just masochism (you know, like enjoying rollercoasters, which I don't, by the way) and how much is some sort of spiritual self-harm (in the mundane sense). The next thought is \"Is there a difference?\" Then I wonder if masochism even makes sense as a concept from a Buddhist point of view, since all cravings are associated with dukkha. Somewhere down the line I was also thinking the obvious, that it appears that I'm for some strange reason clinging to darknight stages. That's an old storyline, too, by the way. I have told it many times, just not originally with dhamma terminology. Well, at least not knowingly with dhamma terminology. Am I maintaining that view too? Or am I just avoiding the responsibility (or the illusion of responsibility) it would take step out of it? Or do I just genuinely have a taste for some of these sensations? How much of that taste depends on the stories we tell, and how much depends on other conditions? Not that they are separable.",

I just couldn't help laughing out loud when I saw the chains of reactions, and that opened up another space. I saw the craving for something that I now know was just a beginner's illusions, and it was comical on so many levels. In the beginning of the session there were fierce vibrations and a loud whirling sound and a sense of a strong force to which I had to surrender, but it just doesn't work the same way since I realized a while back that it was just the attention system that fabricated that force. Part of me almost wished that I had chosen the other pill, just for the joy of the ride, but other parts compared it to that joke about the masochist begging the sadist to hurt them, whereas the sadist says no, which was even more ridiculous since I'm playing both parts but try to maintain the illusion that I'm not. Then I just couldn't take myself seriously anymore. That made it all calm down, both on a sensory level and on a content level, and I was actually just fine with it.

        "msg": "I kind of freaked out yesterday and I can't thank people here enough for all the wise and compassionate advice. I also had an adverse reaction to painkillers (jeeze, I had no idea one could get so sick from regular ibuprofen. I knew it could happen because of histamine intolerance but I thought that if it did it would be much much milder than that), and the two things enhanced each other, I think. Thus I didn't get much sleep, and I was a wreck today. I have had these weird sensations in my head, like from inside my brain, as if there were microscopic explosions going on there. Therefore I intentionally aimed for the kind of meditation session where I fall asleep but stay aware, because that is great rest that seems to be restorative. The session started out thirdvipassanaesque (which I enjoy) but soon got calmer and substantially more relaxed. I fell asleep almost immediately, and I did stay aware. After almost 80 minutes I needed a bathroom break. I was feeling much better. I had done a great deal of unclenching, getting less contracted. As I was still in need of restoration, I decided to continue. That's where it started to be interesting. The disentangling process got some momentum. Once again it was like that mental process used multiple sensory... whatever is the right word. Processing. It's like sensorial thinking, processing mental stuff rather than input from the senses. Somewhere down the line I lost lucidity. I woke up more than two hours later (counting from the end of the bathroom break) and realized that I had been in regular nonlucid sleep with nonlucid dreaming. For me lucid dreaming is more difficult than lucid dreamless sleep. I become too invested in the content. The nada sound is very loud now without being edgy and somewhat disharmonious as it was last night. It feels more like a compassionate space to rest in. Much metta to you all.",

In the beginning I felt tensions so the word \"unclench\" popped up, and at the same time there was a popping sound from the paranasal cavitites. After that, breathing was easier.

I tried it a few times, with the same effect. The popping sound from \"unclench\" was also repeatable. Cool. The clearing up was at several instances followed by a finelined spiral pattern in the murk. I know that sign. It is the first step to a transition into fourth vipassana jhana. I wasn't equanimous enough, so each time, it was interrupted. I think there was some popping sound from inside my head. There were instances of one of my hands moving on its own, at least one instance with each hand. Maybe exactly one of each. At one time my left foot did an upward kicking movement. There was an idea that the stiffness of my neck had been transfered into my left ancle and now it was kicked away.

        "msg": "Appologies that I haven't come around to start a new log, as this one is getting too long. I will soon. Promise. Meditation lately really makes me wonder where the heck all those thoughts and feelings were hiding earlier in my practice when I was trying to find them. It is so noicy in those spaces. Yet there are lots of stuff going on at a sensory level as well, and not all of it seems to have much to do with any of the content of thoughts that pops up above the surface. There seem to be lots of processes going on at the same time, doing their own thing, with some less obvious connections inbetween them. Sensations are much less flowy recently. I'm wondering whether focusing on the earth element now and then has anything to do with it. It's not like I have even succeeded in getting that learning image that is supposed to look just like the clay tray rather than as the opposite of it, or as something moving around, so I didn't expect that it would have any impact outside the immediate practice. Still, as I was reflecting on the difference in my interpretations of sensations, it struck me how similar they are to qualities of the earth element. Sensations feel much more solid, more firm and more stable than I'm used to. It's like a gentle and pretty even and stable pressure, almost like being firmly wrapped up in a blanket. It feels safe but also rigid and... boring. It challenges identity aspects that I apparently cling to (--> dukkha). Apparently I'm deluded enough to think of the flowy unsolidness as me and mine and as something that I can count on to be there. Guess what? It isn't. If just focusing on a clay tray for half an hour now and then can change something that feels so fundamental as \"my own\" sensory experiences, then they can't really be that fundamental or tied to any self. If that is what causes it. I can't be sure. But the change is there, regardless, and that illustrates how dependent sensory experiences are on conditions other than the raw sense data for someone who is still entangled with the dependent origination to the extent of buying into it. I'm curious about how other elements kasinas would possibly impact sensory experiences. Maybe I'll check it out. Apart from that stable pressure there were other things going on, such as movements happening on their own. They can probably be charaterized as kriyas, but they are different from the kriyas I'm used to from before, and similar to what has recently started to appear. Movements that do not seem like some energy burst that just happens to make things move. Movements that have more precision, that seem like they would be done with what people think of as agency, but without any sense of agency. It doesn't feel so weird anymore, but like a normal thing. The practice I was doing this session was as vague as just trying to be aware of what was going on.",

        "msg": "Today has been like a farse, horrible at times but awfully funny with some distanse, and with a happy ending. It could be an entertaining story, but I feel like I'm fed up with the storytelling, as that goes on basically non-stop in my head anyway. Still reobservation-y, but it feels like it is lightening up. I suspect that it will be quite a lot of back and forth for a while, but I don't know. Tomorrow it could seem evident that I was in the lower nanas the whole time, or something else. I have been sick at a train (on the wrong train too), using meditation to make it through it. It helped to some extent and I think the more humbling parts of it was good for my practice, but I would have taken basically any chance to get out of it instead of dealing with it. I'm relieved that I don't know any important nation secrets or similar that would put me into risk of being tortured, because I would easily have said anything to get relief from some forms of suffering. So much aversion. So very unawakened. I did notice the space inbetween the impulses of nausea, though, which is an improvement. I tried to focus on it, but I was caught up in suffering stories over and over again. I can't deal with severe nausea. It gets personal. Well, I did complain that the practice was getting too subtle and too peaceful. Did some warrior seed syllables in the morning. I haven't come around to do that for a while. It felt good doing it. It does something energetically, in a subtle way. Took care of some emotional blockages. That was the happy ending part, which I have the universe to thank for, because taking the wrong train provided an unexpected opportunity that turned out to have perfect timing. It opened up some space. I listened to a dharma talk today about letting go and making space which made me cringe. Not because it wasn't great. It was. But the thought of deleting my entire inbox and trust that the important stuff will come back... In an ultimate sense I can see how that may be true, but in the relative sense, experience tells me that all the important stuff doesn't come back. It just doesn't. And I can see that much of that is because I find too many things important, but it wouldn't just affect me, but others as well, and I don't trust my improvizing skills enough to feel that I would solve situations that might come up in a way that wouldn't cause harm. I can see that there's a lot of doer thinking there, but that's how I currently feel (or at least it's how that behavioral pattern feels that has currently access to the writing programming). The way things turned out unexpectedly well today against all odds may be one step towards being able to let go more, but the way I'm conditioned (hardware and software) will probably require more than that. I have had phases in life when I was basically unable to talk spontaneously without having repeated all possible outcomes of the conversation in my mind before actually having it, so I have let go of a lot, in comparison. I grew up with a horder. There are conditionings to work on, to put it mildly. On the other hand, I think I have let go of plenty of other stuff... bah, there's the storytelling again. Noted. Frustration and judging noted. Metalevels to that noted. Damn it. Anyway... I have integrated intrespective reflections in dealing with stuff today, and I think it may have done some good. In the evening I did a formal sitting for only half an hour which involved surprisingly much space mixed inbetween the monkey mind business and the papancha. There was some kind of disentangling going on that manifested itself kinesthetically, visually and auditorily. It was mainly (or only?) the kinesthetic mode that gave me the impression that it was disentangling that was happening. The visual stuff and the nada sound was happening but I'm not as familiar with that language. I got the impression that the same thing was going on and that it was all connected regardless of sensory mode, but I can't be sure. So much interpretations. How do I know what is the kind of intuition that comes from the process that knows the way and what is really just defense mechanisms or similar stuff dressing up as intuition? I'm used to the idea of having a good intuition, but that's just a view and it is based on false grounds. The three characteristics challenge the core of those grounds pretty badly. It feels a bit like when I was diagnosed as being autistic and it took years to trust myself as a teacher in the field of social interaction.",

I have suspected for a while that histamines are involved in strong Kundalini releases, and I'm histamine intolerant, so... Well, that passes. Something weird happened, or maybe it isn't that weird: I was just watching netflix when suddenly it felt like my entire mouth and the area around it dissolved into an energy field. It started with the mouth and then spread outwards. I lay down for a while, and my body was vibrating. This was in the early afternoon. I decided to do a proper sitting. I sat for an hour, practicing a beginner's version of Dzogchen. As there was still some lingering brain fog, the connection felt a bit off. It was still there but not quite as accessible. It felt like there were energy blockages due to inflammation. I straightened my spine as much as I could, but there were muscle threads that were too tense and that was asymmetrical. I alternated between practicing with eyes closed and eyes open as I find it easier to relax the gaze with my eyes closed but maybe that's cheating. Late afternoon/early evening: 45 minutes reclining practice of letting go, mainly in shavasana. Allowing stuff to untangle. There were some adrenaline surges. There were also brief moments of exquisite presence, with everything feeling brand new. My left shoulder shook itself while vibrating, and that took away some of the pain. I fell asleep but stayed lucid while snoring. It was peaceful. Evening: qigong massage of body and face. Then another hour of sitting, beginner's version of Dzogchen. Now it was more accessible. It was definitely not as blissful as yesterday but I don't think I need it to be. It's fine just as it is - sort of a chrystal clear confusion.",

        "msg": "Morning: 10 min sitting Lunch: 75 minutes very soft yoga While walking to and from yoga class and while doing chores: listened to a dharma talk by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche. While listening to him taking about space, I accidently bumped into the dishwasher lid and hit my shin bone hard. I know how much that usually hurts, but inspired by the talk I said out loud \"Space! There is space! Space! Space!\" and tuned into the space around the pain, and then the pain had already passed away without me focusing on it. I was amazed by the difference it made. Afternoon: 40 min sitting. That space that the silence comes from, and from which also the thoughts come from, is still there. I find it again and again. I think I can trust that it won't go away. However, I find myself trapped by the concept of it now that I finally have a concept for it, and the \"doer\" thinks that it knows how to get there and tries to grab it, and of course that doesn't work. I'm doing my best to give myself a break here. When the \"doer\" misses the target repeatedly, it goes dull to the verge of dozing off. There was plenty of dreaminess. I try to just maintain introspective awareness when that happens, and to work on my posture, and to appreciate the calm and accept that clarity as I'm used to thinking about it comes and goes.",

That is indeed cool. \u2014 Practice log Monday February 3rd Day: 15 minutes sitting. Evening: half an hour sitting, slightly more than half an hour reclining. Not much to report. Tuesday February 4th During the day I felt overwhelmed (fear) and rather sorry for myself (misery) and then, seeing that, I sort of told myself to get a grip (disgust) and just get things done (desire for deliverance), which I did. Reclining session in the evening: At first my body was vibrating. Then lots of dreaminess. Then suddenly it was like everything turned inside out in a fierce whoosh, with great clarity, and there was an electronic screaching sound and sort of a click, and then everything was back to normal as if nothing had happened. Wednesday February 5th Late morning: 20 minutes sitting, opening up to glimpses of the space/presence (=consciousness) from where the silence and the thoughts come. The glimpses were briefer and weaker than a few days ago. I was starting to feel that there was nothing to hold on to, but I had to end the session because of a booked job meeting. Evening: a brief mini-sitting before yoga class. 75 minutes of Ashtanga vinyasa yoga. Relaxation during which my face dissolved into a field of awareness. 75 minutes of slow flow yoga with Kundalini yoga mixed in it, during which I temporarily felt energetic tinglings at the top of my head. Night: 40 minutes of allowing my(not)self to be the space/presence from which the silence and the thoughts come. There was lightness, and my respiratory trakt opened up with some clicking sounds.",

After a while, instead there were lots of sensations taking over. There was no need to do anything with the face. It was a field of awareness. I rested in that for quite a while. There were some kriyas, my left shoulder shaking itself, some fingers moving. Then I fell asleep and listened to myself snoring, fully aware of being asleep and still mindful of the body. Saturday February 8th, 2020 Sitting, 30 minutes, lunch hour. I started out trying to find that space but found frustration and impatience, so instead I started noting. That opened up the space and led to showers of piti. At times I couldn\u2019t verbalize what I noted so I used whatever expression was closest at hand instead. Then I had to grab my stuff and catch a train. Evening: one hour of guided meditation https://youtu.be/SBF4A3NIzr8 and then another 20 minutes of silent meditation. I\u2019m not at home, so I feel guilty for taking the time to meditate instead of being social (yeah, I know that guilt is empty, but I\u2019m contracted today). Lots of tensions, difficulties in letting go, headache, pain in neck, back and knees. Fear that all the lowhanging fruit has already been picked. Thoughts about being stuck. Frustration. Finally some relaxation at the end. And now this damn touchpad won\u2019t recognize my fingers as fingers. Getting angry seems to help with that. That\u2019s a very counterproductive feedback loop. I wonder what it is about my finger tips after meditation that makes them unrecognizable to a touchpad. They aren\u2019t cold. Do some electric impulses calm down? Even during a distracted and restless session?",

I appreciate that I can now see that it isn\u2019t as simple as the fear being there or not being there, and having aversion towards one of those possibilities and craving the other one. The fear is there and I can pick it up or refrain from picking it up.

Focusing on how fear floats around and neglecting to make the same observation with regard to gratitude illustrates that there is still a lingering aversion to fear. Thankyou for pointing that out! I have only had glimpses of what you describe with regard to size and distance. There was one afternoon when I could play with that back and forth. When I tuned into that space or presence that is consciousness being aware of itself (at least that's what I think it is), distances disappeared and I couldn't tell whether something was close and small or distant and large. Everything appeared to be equally near. That is probably just the most basic version of what you describe. I found it kind of cool and I look forward to having perspectives more challenged later on, when my practice has matured enough for that to happen. I'm curious about more details, but maybe it is better not to know too much in advance, to avoid being scripted and to allow for natural curiosity to do its own thing rather than being tempted to tic boxes. Interesting to hear about your new experience of illness. That's cool. I have a changed experience of dissolution. I used to take the fogginness of it very personally and feel like I was foggy in a way that I no longer do. My capacity is still limited by it but the awareness of that is unclouded, even when I fall asleep.",

There were contractions, but it was also obvious that the contractions arose within a space. I have heard that being said, but that's not the same thing as experiencing it empirically my(not)self. I noticed picking up some feelings and could see how it opened some doors and closed others, and how different feelings allowed different possibilities. I investigated my feelings about feelings and how they relate to craving and aversion. I have preferences with regard to feelings to pick up. They are not that straightforward, as I find myself from time to time picking up feelings that cause me suffering. (Maybe all feelings cause us suffering to some extent, but if so, I think that is just part of life.) It is a relief to see that I can pick up other feelings and open other doors, or let go of thoughts and feelings and open other doors. That it isn't linear. I think I have become more comfortable with feelings like fear being around. However, that doesn't mean that there isn't any aversion to fear. I still prefer not necessarily having to pick it up, wheras there's other stuff that I find myself eager to pick up. That space/presence became more easily accessable again towards the end of the session. I definitely wouldn't mind picking that up. Except it can't be picked up. The impulse to pick it up divides it into more of duality again. That's something to work on.",

        "msg": "That's what I usually do. Good to hear that it makes a difference, because it doesn't always feel like it does. Thanks for the encouragement - it is needed. --- Daytime: 45 minutes reclining, mainly checking in with what is going on and trying to relax, because I have a stubborn headache that paracetamol won\u2019t take away, and some nausea. I think it\u2019s Kundalini-related. One of my current Tourette tics is to do the mula-bandha, and I can feel how that pushes up energy to the head and causes pressure there (on the other hand, I have really poor sight and haven\u2019t had proper glasses for a long time, which I have finally gotten around to make an appointment for, so that could very well be the main cause). Anyway, lying down felt good, and the respiratory tract cracked open with a number of clicks. I felt meeyes relaxing and defocusing behind closed eyelids. There was lightness and spaciousness. The space is not a visual thing for me, at least not primarily. I find it easier to compare to sound. I\u2019m no audio engineer, but I can hear the difference between a very compact mix and one that is more spacious. I have always preferred the latter one, which doesn\u2019t seem very modern. If you listen to recordings of The Mission UK back in the 80\u2019s, there was a lot of space in their sound. For me, that\u2019s a relief. I don\u2019t like when the sound is too dense. The spaciousness during meditation feels similar. There is just more space inbetween stuff. Less density. Easier to breathe. Relief. Or like being on a hill out in the countryside or in the wild with lots of air and no traffic, no buildings, and no people around, or alone by the sea. This time it was more a construction of spaciousness than that special feeling that I refer to as the space or presence that the silence comes from; that is something else, more like a recognition or dejavue, an unplacable sense of familiarity. Towards the end of the session there was a loud clicking sound that for some reason startled me. Evening: 100 minutes of reclining practice. I still have a headache. 3C nana? It did feel a bit like reobservation without the oumph that third vipassana jhana brings about. The nada sound was sharp. There was some bubbliness, a bit like carbon dioxide, but not that much, and after a phase of distracting thoughts and movements, the mind calmed down. Instead there was the feeling of something melting near my cheek bones, at the spot where the salivary gland is positioned. There were flourescent purple swirls and pleasantness. For a while I focused on my breath and was close to jhana, but then I lost interest in that. There was some dreaminess. I noticed it fast every time. I wanted to turn it into lucid dreaming in order to test if I can go through a wall, but I never managed to imagine any wall or dream of one, and as soon as I noticed dreaminess it was already gone. Somewhere along the line there were kriyas and some startling responses. Also, there was some breathing of the type that sounds like being asleep.",

I thought of it as what we humans do - construct whole packages. This is why I often find it so confusing to use Shinzen Young's noting that is based on what senses are used, even for thoughts. I find myself having all senses integrated in so much of my experiences. There is just no way I could hear one of my cats without at the same time mentally smelling them, feeling their touch, seeing them, thinking about them and feeling something. There is even some kind of taste to the experience. Maybe my cats bring out the equanimity in me. But that's how I usually perceive things when I tune into them, like if I listen to the cars passing by outside. That makes me feel the sensations of being out in my patio, with the cool moist air against my skin, all the smells, the taste of the air in my mouth, and there are also vague visual glimpses of a car. In some phases other things dominate, though. Sometimes what dominates is something as weird as feeling the ground under my wheels and the power of my motor.",

I was surprised by how much easier it was now compared to when I started my daily practice. I have been under the impression that my practice basically sucks now, so that was en eye opener. I ended with \"do nothing\" and found that familiar space that recognizes itself. Then 75 minutes of Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga and 75 minutes of slow flow yoga with some integrated Kundalini yoga.

        "msg": "My first formal practice today was when I came home from an exhausting meeting on top of the work day (note: the contextualized descriptions of daily life are for the purpose of personal retrospection about what methods worked for what purposes; others are welcome to skip them unless they find the context useful). I thought it might be a good idea to use a simple meditation to check in with what was going on and then let go of it. I used a 30 minutes vipassana timer with a gong every 5 minutes, that is six slots. Slot 1: getting settled and grounded. Any form of noting/noticing is allowed. I find it helpful to contact all my senses and my thoughts and feelings, the former in order to ground/stabilize myself and the second in order to prepare myself for what may be difficult to let go of. I skipped verbal notes and went for fast noticing. That worked. The cycling seems to be relatively fluid now, not so much subjective experience of getting stuck, not so much difficulty with dullness or distractions. Focusing on the task was easy. Slot 2: body sensations. Good clarity. Fine-grained, fast. A couple of brief instances of distracting thoughts. Slot 3: thoughts. Good access to thoughts without getting lost in content. The two main categories were non-discursive thoughts popping up and disappearing (often but not always as associations from sounds or body sensations) and meditation-related mental talk. The latter can be divided into different categories. Some of it was investigation, using concepts as tools. Most of the time I found that even that was often redundant, though, because the discursive thoughts about the investigation were merely the kazoo player translating into words what had already been investigated. Much of it was polishing on those translations (more kazoo player) and repeating them (kazoo player grabbing the thoughts out of fear of forgetting them). Much was also analysis, such as some version of the division into categories that I'm now presenting, with a similar tail of polishing and repeating. There were also evaluations of the practice, of what categories there \"should\" be less from, and on the meta level evaluations of the evaluation. That brought about some confusion and some methodological reflections. I found myself dropping some thoughts as if they were burning, because they were judgemental, and then realizing that dropping them aggressively like that was also judgemental, and there were impulses to drop those thoughts in the same way, but that could go on forever. There was the chain of thoughts that I now understand why some teachers emphasize working with a teacher so much. Being my own teacher I kind of have to evaluate my own practice, and it is tempting to do it while I'm practicing, but that doesn't work that well. Then I did let go, not aggressively, but because it was the only way not to get caught in a loop forever, which I understood and accepted quickly. There is quite a lot of text here about something that went on for maybe a couple of seconds including the confusion. There were also instances of just resting in the space where thoughts arise. Slot 4: this was supposed to be feelings but I forgot about that and went with noticing whatever stood out as most prominent in any given moment. Mainly body sensations, hearing, formations and thought chains. I didn't get lost in content or get dull. Some instances of space inbetween the input, noticing the space as that recognition. Slot 5: doing nothing. Initially I was a bit racey after all the fast noting, but I could drop that relatively fast and instead dwell in the space. There was a flickering that I realized was me trying to hard to \"stabilize\" the non-focus. When I noticed that, I dropped it, and then it was more effortless. Slot 6: I was surprised that there was a remaining slot. First I thought I must have miscalculated and decided to do another slot of doing nothing, but there was a lingering suspicion that I had missed something, and I realized that I had forgotten the feelings slot. Thus I focused on feelings. By now I was mainly equanimous with a tone of happiness and love (for instance towards the cat in my lap) but there was remaining dukkha that manifested as very subtle anxiety underneath everything. I tested myself a bit, turned my thoughts intentionally towards stuff that cause me stress in daily life. There was an emotional response to those thoughts, but it was mild and it wasn't sticky.",

Maybe we are using the word clarity differently. I don't use it exclusively for being able to zoom in more and more, but that would be a possible way of using the concept too. I'm using the concept clarity for seeing things like they are (if that can ever be done; I guess that depends on how we define \"like they are\"). In Shinheads people aim for increasing their clarity. To me it doesn't make sense that the goal should be to neglect how the human mind empirically functions. But then again, I'm talking about epistemology, not ontology. It is a fact that at a certain stage we see things like this. Sure, I guess we could say that it's poor clarity, but if we are striving for clarity and a higher nana means decreased clarity, then that would imply that one would like to avoid the higher nanas.

I have been having an earworm today, a song that we used to sing in a choir 20 years ago or so, 25 maybe. The lyrics were in French, and I don't speak French. Thus I couldn't remember more than a few words, which is kind of irritating when you have a tune stuck in your head. After lunch I decided to do a reclining letting go meditation, typically the sort of meditation where I risk falling asleep. I needed to rest anyway, so why not. After a couple of unknowing events I was very relaxed and fell asleep. I stayed lucid but didn't have any thoughts that I can recall apart from recognizing being asleep and hearing and feeling the breath and the occasional snoring. After one and a half hour I had to wake myself up and go to the bathroom. There I found myself singing the song, with the complete lyrics in French. I could even remember the spelling of most of it. Now I\u2019ll try to describe the first part of the session. I started reciting what Shargrol suggested as an intention in Siavash\u2019s practice log. Then I lay down and listened to a guided meditation by Adyashanti on \u201dthe most essential\u201d: https://youtu.be/427Zzw6XuuU It felt good. I remember that there were some rather stubborn thoughts in the very beginning and that I let go of them. Now I can't even remember them.

        "msg": "Today's practice: Morning: 75 minutes Vinyasa yoga, 60 minutes Yin yoga Afternoon: the reclining guided session reported above Evening on the cushion practice so far: 30 minutes of diagnostic and warming up practice + 45 minutes of noticing widely without grabbing onto stuff, and of investigating when grabbing occurred The 30 minutes session was divided into six slots. I have modified the structure a bit. 1: noticing widely to get settled and get grounded. 2: bodily sensations. 3: the interaction between thoughts and feelings. 4: noticing whatever predominates in every given moment. 5: whatever I want to investigate further. 6: \"do nothing\". Some observations: My pulse (of blood) makes a ticking noice in my head. Energetic sensations on different parts of my scalp, apart from the usual energy field of the body. A combo of lots of spaciousness and lots of contractions. A feeling of diminished gravity with some lightheadedness. Sounds from outside the apartment makes my mind sort of expand to experience the outside. Investigations mainly occur without language. They sort of follow the structure of a question and follow-up questions until emptiness is revealed, but each question takes maybe a fraction of a second. I do not see the need for retrospective tracking of those questions and how they could be translated into words. The important thing is that they do what they are supposed to do. Since those habitual patterns that I investigate are very strong, the contractions reappear over and over again in very similar ways, so I repeat the procedure over and over again. Thus the fluctuation of expansions and contractions. When I tune into the space/presence/ground of being/whatever it's called, I can \"see\" those expansions and contractions. It flickers in and out of access.",

        "msg": "Morning: attended yoga workshop focusing on space element. Great yoga class, learned a lot, challenged my ideas of what is anatomically possible for this body. Afternoon: 30 minutes of warming up sitting with six slots. Decided that \"bodily sensations\" include sensations of the energy body even if it means that they are outside the physical body. I assess that I'm on the threshold between reobservation and equanimity (at risk of dropping down to A&P since that pathway/portal seems easily accessible for me, cycling back and forth between those three nanas). There are mind-racing and energetic sensations and contractions and feedback loops tripping over themselves and earworms and third vipassana jhana and at the same time a sense of relief and space and optimism, and mind looking at itself occasionally. I like this place. I definitely see the dukkha in it, and wouldn't mind going passed that, but that is one of the reasons that I like it. It has lowhanging fruit. Small changes make great differences in this place. It's dynamic. I don't know which path I'm on. It's somewhere beyond SE. It seems to me like the territory between first and third, as mapped on this forum, contains a vaste number of insight cycles. There are things to learn, insights to make and territories to explore; that's what matters. As soon as my afternoon ADHD medication kicks in, I'll do a longer session.",

        "msg": "Yeah, I feel you, and it seems perfectly valid. I just don't have the same need. When people get into long intellectual discussions about concepts in the dharma, I usually get bored. I often say that language isn't my language. Lots of my processing, even the conscious processing, takes place on a pre-linguistic level. I think that has to do with being autistic. I think in textures and other sensory impressions that are linked and overlayed in intricate ways. If I will ever teach the dharma, which I have no plans for at the moment, I'll probably teach people who think more like me. There aren't many teachers like that. Probably not many students either, but those who do think like me most likely have a hard time finding someone who speaks their language. I have no intention whatsoever to engage in long and intricate theoretical teachings. Even in my research at the University, I am an empiricist. I have never thought about Husserl and company being awakened. I really have no idea, but why would they? Kirkegaard does not strike me as someone who had recuced his suffering. Not Camus either. The thought has popped up about Parfit, though, but I haven't read that much of him so that is too much to say. I think awakening by way of intellectual reasoning is probably at least very unusual. I don't think it's that common to reach arahantship within a year from reading a dharma book either, even if it is a great one. I find it likely that Jesus was awakened, but even though I live in a country that has had hundreds of years of Christian tradition, that is not the original roots here, and it's a secularized society, and I don't have any relationship to Christian mystics. I don't understand why they would be closer to me than anything else. I'll use the tech that I find works for me, and I find that the Buddhist framework really works. I enjoyed reading your post, though, and I look forward to reading more about your findings. As for names, any of them is fine.",

        "msg": "Thankyou, Tim! I had already forgiven you, but I appreciate that (mundane but still great) realization. Tourette's is still very stigmatized and the activism among ticcers is merely in its cradle as internalized shame is still so predominating. Living with Tourette's is extremely draining. Or it was. My take on Tourette's is that it is both a magnifying glass on the dukkha and an increased sensitivity to noticing the dissolution of the self and the world resulting in contractions/grasping as the ego's defense mechanism. I have noticed that when I can let go of ticcing, stuff dissolves. As someone with Tourette's, I find it fascinating that people often have such a hard time noticing sensations in their body. I never had that problem. I always feel a great variety of sensations at the soles of my feet when I walk and at the same time I feel the touch of my clothes on every inch of my skin and the touch of the wind. That's the minimum baseline while I go about doing stuff. I can't imagine how it would be not to feel that. There is a great fictional depiction of a character with Tourette's in the book Motherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Lethem. I can't vouch for the movie version, though, because I haven't seen it.",

I relistened to the broadcast in the morning, after too few hours of sleep, and it was great, but I fell asleep again. I'll listen to the last part of her session later today, because it is gold. She speaks my language, talking about energetically feeling stuff. If I ever get into serious difficulties with energetic pain or other energetic stuff, she's the one I'll contact (for all other spiritual emergencies, Daniel would be the first one to call). So far I haven't needed it. I am curious about what she would be able to teach me, though. Doing the 30 minutes non-meditation/Dzogchen on an empty stomach and before the ADHD medication kicked in wasn't ideal. Distracting thoughts did not immediately self-liberate. There were moments of strong presence, though, without a \"just me\" to be, so I can see that this is the way to centerlessness. I intend to keep doing this, ideally more than once a day (including shorter sessions that can easily be squeezed in) but with a minimum of 30 unbroken minutes.",

        "msg": "One of the listeners calling into the Mukti broadcast described something that sounded very similar to my experience of the lovemaking between emptiness and awareness, although the way she framed it, she seemed to be bothered by the lack of control over it. She called it ascensions and descensions, so first I thought she was talking about what I used to call expansions and contractions and that used to bother me because the contractions involved so much tension. Mukti replied in a way that makes me think that she made a very similar interpretation. Her recommendations were then both to tap into the stillness and to connect to energies that balance each other, just like I have been doing, because she thought that the caller had had her energetic field opened up without having enough of a connection with the stillness to balance it. When the caller explained further, she described very similar qualities as that cosmic lovemaking nondual absorption, and then Mukti said that it was a good sign and recommended the caller to find pleasure in the experience. To another caller who had energetic pain, she recommended no poking. I love Mukti. --- I'm sitting in a meadow full of wood anemones, taking in the outer elements. If I feel like it, I will also go to a pond nearby, to add water to the mix (all the others are available in abundance). I did the same thing yesterday before yoga class. It helps me to reconnect with inner stillness.",

I would trust her as a teacher. --- I didn't go to that pond but instead a payed a short visit to a set of rocks with marks from glacial action when the inland ice melted at the end of the ice age. That kind of ground is often the safest bet of finding the kind of vibrational energy that feels so good within walking distance in a town, I find, probably because it has been left relatively untouched when the surrounding environment has been manipulated over and over again. I know that there is no ultimate truth to that kind of energy, but there is no ultumate truth to paying taxes either and yet I find it meaningful to pay them. Tapping into energies is an important tech for my wellbeing, and it increases the degree of connection in my meditation practice. There have been non-dual whiffs during the day. Like seeing a horse and instantly having the whole package of sensations that comes with it, not only how it would feel to touch it and how it would smell and the sounds it makes, or the sense of its movements when riding it (not that I have done much horseback riding), but also the sense of how it feels to have that posture and move my body like the horse, and the feeling of having my hooves firmly placed on the ground. There have also been brief clicks in my head, the kind that doesn't feel like paranasal cavities popping open (well, I have that too) or like sudden shifts in mental states but still doesn't come close to that very special feeling of coming back from an impermanence door fruition. It's more like new synapses are forming or something like that. No nausea from walking today. I don't know if the change into perceiving the ground as moving relative to me instead of me moving relative to it (the latter because of the brain's photoshopping) has remained or if it was a temporal thing. It feels like it is back to normal but I'm confused about what normal means (even more so than usually). That spot on the top of my head to the left, the one that had like electrical surges yesterday (?), feels warm and sort of activated. The energy channels are open, making breathing very easy. There is a subtle sense of difference in pressure between inside and outside of my head, as if on an air plane. There is a very subtle pressure at the third eye point. I don't believe that energies can really be trapped inside the head, so that doesn't bother me. Besides, I have had the subjective experience before of having the energies project out from the physical body and forming a large spheric field around it, so I know that it is open. I don't feel contracted around the heart anymore. Whatever the intense heat in the heart chakra was, I think it did something. I'm having trouble getting the touch pad to respond to my fingers again. I seem to have an energetic signature that it can't read properly (it can usually read other people's fingers when I ask them to try). That happens (not only with touch pads). It feels like something \"wants\" to happen. Thankyou Malcolm for suggesting to do the non-meditation thing. It was the push I needed to get back to connecting with the dance of the stillness. It is in line with both the Lama Lena teachings and the Ligmincha classes, as well as with what Michael Taft teaches nowadays at SH Dharma Collective and most teachings that I find myself drawn to. It is all too easy to get busy with the other parts of the teachings, but this is the most essential part.",

        "msg": "I've got to say that it took me some time and a lot of frustration to feel what that exercise is designed to illustrate. One reason was that I had just started to tap into a broader awareness, which doesn't function like attention does, and the exercise is about investigation attention. However, the main reason was that it was difficult to focus so singlepointedly with remaining alertness. I was prone to both distraction and dullness. Actually, this makes me realize: I owe Chris a great deal for that exercise, because the dullness I experienced from it made me take up yoga again, and more systematically than ever before. Getting some physical exercise was Chris's idea. At that time I had severe histamine reactions even from minimal physical strain. If I walked up a staircase, I'd lose my voice for a week. I was suffering from chronic fatigue. I even had a mattress on the kitchen floor so I could lie down while cooking food. I had been trying to cure myself with exercise and it had only gotten worse. I did some very light zumba classes together with seniors. Some of the seniors took three classes in a row. If I endured more than half a class, I would get some really strange bodily reactions (I have now realized that they were Kundalini-related, like many others things I have gone through) and a rapid development of stomach flue. It resembled the beginning of anafylactic shock, but it never developed into anything dangerous, and according to tests, it seemed to be something else. I was extremely sensitive even to walking. Thus, getting exercise was easier said than done. I did have positive experiences from yoga, though. That seemed to be the only physical strain that my body could tolerate. So I found myself a yoga studio that was close enough for me to actually go there and started doing yoga at a frantic rate. I felt that I couldn't afford having all that brain fog if I were to meditate. And wow, what a difference it made. I no longer have chronic fatigue. I don't suffer from brain fog anymore. It also helped with other energetic symptoms. This is why I still take yoga classes in the midst of the corona pandemic. It is my lifeline. Thankyou Chris! Actually, the way you make long association chains and the rapidness of it, and the vibes around it, you kind of remind me of people with Tourette. That's a compliment. Also, bipolar and Tourette's tend to coexist within families. As far as I know, there is a genetic connection. Many years ago I read that there was a hypothesis that the same genes that led to bipolar disorder in some family members, led to Tourette's in others. It may have been an epigenetic thing. I haven't followed up on that report, though.",

I don't know if that was the 10.4 nana or if I fled back into pure A&P. Anyway, it was a pleasant hitchhike from the ripple effects of the mindfucking dramas of yesterday. I did some guru yoga with warrior seed syllables (yes, I'm doing that routine in spite of the absurdity of visualizing a milky white liquid coming down over me from Taphiritsa who appears to be totally butt-naked in the pictures; in doing it, I'm not visualizing it like that , okay). It started to cut through the very much embodied hypomania. Then I did the inner refuge prayer (also Ligmincha stuff) and then lay down to open up to the inner stillness, the silence and the spaciousness. It was a haven. I fell asleep while retaining lucidity. I was sleep deprived, so that was a blessing. It was very bright for a while, and there was a strong presence. Then I listened to myself snoring for quite some time, just being there with my sleeping body. Then it was bright again. Then there were thoughts, and there was a recognition that the stillness was still with me. One of the first thoughts that appeared was that the non-doer paradox is none other than the usual determinism vs free will conundrum, and I concluded 25 years ago that I'm a compatibilistic determinist, and that seems to hold up to phenomenology. I didn't suddenly vaporize like a mirage 25 years ago upon realizing that, so there is no risk that I will now. And I recalled a friend of mine telling me about how one of the other students in her anthropology class suddenly rised up from her seat saying \"This is all an illusion. None of you exists.\" She had then walked out from the class never to come back. At least she had the decency not to ask any of her \"non-existing\" class mates for donations. I guess she had gotten rid of some more fetters.",

It unfolded as some degree of non-dual absorption without discursive thinking for large parts of it, after a period of unclenching. When discursive thinking appeared again, the body was still resting in direct awareness. I dwelled in that for a little while before I ended the session. The unclenching refers to noticing that body parts are clenched up and allowing them to let go. It is weird how some tensions arise over and over again. It is often the shoulders and the neck. I somehow tend to arch my chest upwards and tilt my neck backwards, like in exorcism movies. I also often get painful cramps in my ankles. It seems like that's where blockages move when they are released somewhere else, and then I need to move them to get the tensions out of my system and allow energies to move more freely. I have some of those head poppings again. I think the kind of work I'm doing now is preparation work. I seem to need it in some parts of the spiraling. It seems like it's a process of alligning the subconscious by using one of its languages, that is, kinesthetic energy work.

Then I popped back up to conceptualization a bit before he said to do so.

I'm not pushing myself away from the floor, but the floor away from me, tilting it. Walking through the spring evening was magickal.

So present. So obvious. The idea of being a perceiver just felt ridiculous, as every sensation was so tangibly self-aware. It's just that some of the sensations involve the notion of belonging. It's not that I as a perceiver own the sensations. They assembly together to do being me. Others involve the notion of being other than me but perceived by me. But they are all just awareness. Those that do not involve any notion whatsoever with regard to me, they just know themselves too, and most of the time the me-related sensations do not involve any knowledge of them. Sometimes they seem to do, and that's when it gets a bit woo woo. Other times, they probably don't, but the perspective changes so that the \"reference point\" is something other than me. For instance, for a while during this meditation, it felt like the self was in the body of my cat who was lying in my lap. I could also easily get the feeling of being a pillow on my bed or something. But the visuals were still coming from my eyes. I don't have enough visual imagination to shift figure and ground visually in a way that would change that, or at least that is what I believe. My beliefs probably set the limits to sensations. I could however imagine scratching that itch and getting the desired relief so vividly that I actually got the relief as if I had been scratching myself. I simply believed what Michael had said, that you can only desire an outcome that is already there in awareness.",

        "msg": "The evening sit yesterday felt great. Tawa was very accessible. Doing the morning sessions really pays off. Later at night I got into a restless mood of obsessively searching the internet for ritual objects. Very typical desire for deliverance. I want to make a smoke offering but I don't have the right equipment, but hey, what's the rush anyway? I don't even like the sound of those bells. I think they have a terrible sound. And why would spirits around here even have preferences for Tibetan symbols? They probably couldn't care less. I also got riled up because a person from my meditation class was sort of badmouthing Daniel based on what seemed to me like obvious misconceptions, and for some reason that just pissed me off. She had all sorts of opinions about awakening with no base in phenomenology whatsoever, and I got reactive the same way that I recently observed in a thread here and pointed out that one might benefit from looking into. Obviously I have attachments with regard to awakening and people's ideas about it. That's something to work with. It also kind of pisses me off that she has so many opinions about how the class should be taught. It sounds like she thinks that benefits from meditation is a package that you can buy and that as a customer you have the right to a certain experience and that you can sort of pick and choose what should come out of it - as if it could be designed. Apparently that bothers me. It also bothers me that I notice a tendency in myself to think of her as ignorant when she expresses herself like that. That's me being judgemental. I don't like it (and that is another level of judging). The question is: Why am I turning this into a personal thing? For both those reasons I couldn't sleep, so I ended up taking part in Michael's death sangha session via zoom at SF Dharma Collective. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m morbid or suppressing things or just microslept through parts of it (it started at four o'clock in the morning in my time and we were encouraged to lie down and relax), but I loved it. It very soon turned into something vibrational for me. Already when I was settling in, I had sort of the tunnel experience. I was being drawn in. After the initial shamatha part, things were happening, different things, but most of the time Michael's voice was just sound. Still, things seemed to happen as a response to the different sounds. I can\u2019t conceptualize most of it. There were kriyas and lots of letting go and it felt great. I felt completely safe. Hearing the reports from others afterwards, I came to realize that some pretty harsh details of the dying experience had been vividly described. I'm familiar with those from before, as they were the standard Tibetan desciption of the dying process. Afterwards I dreamt that I was being choked to death. First I reacted with fear, but then I remembered that I had been doing death sangha and thought \u201dhey, this is what I\u2019m practicing for\u201d, and then the fear dissolved. I have been doing a bardo prayer that describes the different stages of the dying process and what happens in the bardo. I like doing that before going to sleep. For same reason, I find it comforting. Also, I find that it somewhat resembles the stages of falling asleep. --- Morning sit (well, more like lunch time sit, but morning for me after that night): 30 minutes. A combination of tawa and distracted thoughts. No embodied restlessness, with a few subtle exceptions, but an active mind going about its default business. Good mood. Loud nada sound. A sense of trust in the process. Now, afterwards, I have tics, which tells me that contraction is going on. It's not that bad, though. There is also a bright calmness in the background, shining through.",

The space that is nowhere and everywhere. The silence and stillness at the centre of everything - and the unveiled awareness that is the inherent tendency of it. That takes me to this great effortless presence which is spacious but not flickering around. There is such a great relief from the contracted state of focused attention. Natural mind. I love it.

        "msg": "I don't mind discussing the technicalities of the practice at all. That's what I come to this forum for. However, I really don't know. In my case, I didn't exactly plan it. I was merely trying to find a reliable way to fourth jhana, as I had only arrived there without knowing what I was doing. I still haven't found any reliable way, and it's not any top priority, but it sure was effective that time. A little too effective, as I had to struggle to get out of that loop to get at least some sleep. I think it was the suffering door, too. It wasn't exactly pleasant. The cessations felt like gradually having consciousness get sucked into a black hole, with the whole spaghetti effect and everything. I still can't quite figure out how that was even compatible with having nothingness disappearing before that. It seems like there should be less than nothing there to get sucked in, so how could it even get drawn out like spaghetti? Maybe it was the duration that was still there, until it wasn't. I have never been able to do the jhanic arc in the 3C nana, so I can't tell if it's a good idea. I'm just too pissed off in the 3C nana to do jhanas. If you want to tune into the Dharmakaya nature of mind, you can tune into what's behind the sound. The silent space or non-space from which it comes. The eye of the hurricane that is completely still and silent. That's one of my favorite ways of doing it. If it works, it might be a way to get more space into that energy body of yours, instead of being like a champagne bottle with a cork that has somehow gotten stuck. I'm not suggesting that you should abandon your go-to method. Noting is a great method for that nana. However, if you need some rest inbetween your noting sessions, it's one thing to try. There are lots of things to actively investigate with the nada sound, too. You can zoom in on different parts of it and zoom out and turn it into clear tones. You can notice what happens with your mind when you zoom in on different parts of the sound. Or you can just ignore it and focus on something that suits you better. Or you can notice how different mind sets affect the nada sound. Of course the nada sound isn't really separate from your mind, but dualistically speaking. I don't know if any of this made any sense. Tired brain. At least I managed to do morning sits again today, 1h+ divided into two sessions. It was very well needed. That chatty brain of mine really needed some cleaning out. I had been helping my brother with a delicate situation, and it involved some heavy triggers. He isn't triggering me, but he has been treated unjustly. When it comes to keeping calm and finding the right diplomatic and yet assertive words in situations like that, my family counts on me. I can do it, but oy vey, is it draining. This was just a minor thing compared to the whole process, and things are going his way now, thankfully, but we wanted to make a statement for the record, one that was constructive but also rectified the wrongs that might others remain in the fake history.",

        "msg": "Continuously loving the morning sits. They are gradually getting longer. Sometimes I do several sits in the morning, sometimes I just do one because I have other things to attend to. I have now added an altar procedure to the morning ritual, and I find that it's a good way to wake up and set the tone for the day. It helps activating the central channels. There was this weird thing, though. When I had put the altar into place, I was tired and didn't feel like doing the procedure that day because it would demand executive functioning and I didn't want to waste batteries for the battery candles and whatever, but that just felt completely wrong after a while, like I was taking away all the energy from this magickal construct and depleting it. Another thing that felt completely wrong was that I had moved too many objects from my previous altar, one that I had never planned to make but that sort of grew dynamically. There was this strong feeling of nausea. I had to put back the objects that belonged to that altar and do the procedures for the Buddhist altar. So now I have two different altars that apparently do something for me. I think the old one is sort of a grounding protection altar. It's very simple, especially now that I have moved away lots of props to a shelf under the Buddhist altar (which is in a book shelf with glass doors), but I love it. It's on top of a chest. That problem with getting my fingers to register as fingers on the touch pad is back. Moving energy back to my fingers still works, and it's the only thing that works. I don't know how to explain this scientifically. Maybe it has to do with electromagnetic fields or something. Right now I have to do it very often and it dosn't last very long. There isn't much to say about my practice at the moment. I know what I need to do and how to do it, and I'm doing it. I will continue to do it until there is no illusion whatsoever that I'm doing it. The access to rigpa or whatever you want to call it varies, or that's how it seems. Apparently I can nowadays assembly IKEA furniture without going all Donald Duck about it. I have the practice to thank for that. Last meditation class we were instructed to from empty awareness let a chosen subpersonality/behavioral pattern arise and just be with it. I chose the part that is keeping busy, the easily distracted airy aspect. That's tricky to work with because of what it is, so I didn't get that deep into it, but I managed to realize something new about it because I could feel kinesthetically what it was like. It was tiptoeing to accomodate the perceived needs of all the other aspects. It's not the \"one\" wanting to avoid awakening. It just perceives that there are other patterns reacting to the process, and it enables them to avoid it by offering distractions. It was like the nervous hostess never daring to sit down and relax and trust the guests to take care of their own needs. Meanwhile, she's missing out on the party and missing out on being present with the guests. All I need to do is to get her to see that her presence is what is most appreciated. Then of course those other patterns will have to grow up and face their own reality. I'm looking forward to that. It is happening, gradually. The one-on-one advice was about moving on in the middle paths. It was mainly about learning what small things make all the difference. Michael also said that beginning the practice with shamatha before dropping the ball usually helps stabilizing the nondual experience once it kick in. Tonight there will be an online trekcho session, then meditation class meeting, then Lama Lena teachings on the six paramitas. Tomorrow the closed teachings on extraordinary ngundro will begin.",

It's just that sometimes my energy is where it's supposed to be whereas \"I\" am not. And if I keep insisting on being where my energy isn't, then I will get depleted. So the next time it happens, I'll try to just get some space to it and tune into where I'm supposed to be. How could I not see that? It's so obvious and so litteral.

        "msg": "Okay, so now I have committed to doing a sadhana practice wholeheartedly for three months, several times per day, starting before sunrise, with repeated chanting in Tibetan and full prostrations and visualizations and \"feelizations\". How did that happen, haha? I think it's a beautiful practice, though. It has a magic to it. There is surrender and mercy and transcendence of the individual self. I might just like it. I'm so grateful that I have already started to set the alarm to get up in the morning to practice. I'll just have to set it earlier for a while, before it gets darker. Later I may actually get to sleep in, because the sun rises very late in the winter up here. Swedish daylight isn't exactly suitable for measuring the day. Parts of Sweden don't have any daylight at all during parts of the winter, and during the summer the sun is up non-stop. Where I live, closer to the south of Sweden, it's less extreme, but still... I'll use common sense. I did a live guided lucid sleep meditation earlier today. I asked someone close to me to do it for me. I had some stuff that needed integration. I went through a phase of dream images coming up while I was still able to talk. Then it got all vibrational, then almost completely still and yet conscious. Then I surfaced back up again, rejuvinated. I did morning sits of trekcho too, much later than I had planned due to health issues. I had a histamine hangover caused by very modest amounts of black pepper. Doing the altar ritual and the morning sits, all in good company by my morning meditation partner, helped me to overcome the pain and the brain fog. Today I saw how I keep limiting myself with regard to what I believe is possible. I was talking about it as something I had learned from some isolated happenings, such as realizing that the universe gives me very strong hints about wasting my enegy on the wrong stuff. Then I was talking about how I would most likely continue to mess it up anyway. As an example I took some present challenges, such as dealing with all the office stuff that have been delivered to my home now that I don't have an office anymore. There are huge amounts of books and papers, quite the mess, and I don't have room for it and still I'll need much of it for the book I'm writing (one of them anyway). I said out loud, jokingly, \"Why can't the universe just take care of that for me?\" My partner asked me if there's any storage room available, and that reminded me that I actually have a storage room included in my rent that I have never used, because when I moved in it didn't have any floor and it seemed easier to just use the shed in my patio. Since then others have been using my storage space and I have never bothered to do something about it. Recently the landlord put up announcements in the hallway that anybody who is using somebody else's storage space needs to clear out their stuff, and otherwise they will empty the space for them on October 5th. So actually, the universe has already taken care of it. I just didn't see that. Isn't that sort of amazing?",

Then I attended to the altar, then did my first sit of trekcho for about half an hour. I forgot to take my first round of ADHD medication but I didn't need it to wake up and clear my head. The sadhana was way more effective than dexamphetamine. I feel great! It's a combination of surrender, determination, confidence and peace. There is also a sense of priorities being much clearer. Wasting energy on worrying about all the stuff that I need to do just seems irrelevant and counterproductive. I'm having breakfast now and then I'm going for another round of sadhana practice.",

        "msg": "The last few days I have been feeling really heavy energies, and I blamed pms and the lack of light (light changes really quickly in Sweden at this time of the year) and conditions around me (for a while it seemed like our option for helping my kid to get the right care had been taken away, but thankfully it has now been sorted out). Most of all I thought I was doing something wrong with my practice. Tawa felt much less accessible, and the energy channels seemed closed. I was back to normal breathing again, and since I have been spoiled with extraordinarily smooth breathing for quite some time, that felt awfully heavy. Yesterday it dawned on me that I was doing it again. I was letting \"my energies\" (or whatever it is) leak out, as if that would help anyone else. Someone I love is depressed now, so that's one of the directions they would try to go. So I did as adviced by my yoga teacher, the healer: I evoked my free will (which seems counterintuitive from a Buddhist perspective, but I guess it could be translated as setting an intention) and returned energies that weren't mine and called back energies who were mine (or whatever it is - I don't really believe in me or mine, but this body needs some kind of life force). I also asked the universe to send healing energies to my loved one from its greater supply. Doing this led to opening of the energy channels, just like that, and gave me back my smooth breathing. It was easier to open up to tawa. Wow. During the night, I sweated out the heaviness. I can feel that my thought patterns are more open now. I'm now on my way to a job interview. This seems to be right livelihood, so I'm asking Tara to be with me. Trying to connect to my inherent Buddha nature, the one that we all have.",

It's a sense of the face melting drip by drip and that sort of thing. It turned out that they are definitely strong enough. Subtle doesn't equal weak. I'm really untrained right now, and not even that motivated, and yet it took me to third. That's good to know. Gosh, those jhanas feel so dense and heavy compared to spacious Dharmatta experiences. I do appreciate the contrast between different experiences, though, so nothing wrong with that. I just wonder how I didn't notice that heaviness earlier in my practice. Well, actually I don't. It's very understandable. But it's sort of comical. I think I may have missed out on many opportunities for jhana just because I didn't recognize the onset of the lower ones now that they feel so heavy. By the way, I so want that job! It seems increadibly fun! Tawa is readily available again. Breathing is easier. Central channels are easily activated.",

Today I woke up with a histamine reaction, fairly brain foggy and with a sore body, wounds inside my mouth, contracted fascia and lots of impulses to clench (tics), etc. Taking care of the altar and doing the sadhana and the trekcho still sort of holds the energy and creates space. Later I tried to do one of Michael's guided meditations, but the process decided that it was time for lucid sleeping instead. On the way down to mere awareness of awareness, I heard myself sleep breathing, including the kind of breath that cleans out toxins. This helped with the clenching. Then I did shamatha on relaxing the third eye. That made the singlepointed focus feel less claustrophobic and resulted in a fairly stable first jhana that didn't feel so dense and heavy. Then I did a longer version of the sadhana and then trekcho. Tonight there will be online group practice of Trekcho and then live teachings with Lama Lena.",

I chose the boxes from my office and the chaos that takes form as soon as I try to unpack them. I really poked in it, recalling the piles of unsorted papers and all the work it will take to get it all organized, which is usually tangibly Angst-provoking to the extent that just the flash of a thought about it has involved immediate contraction of the entire chest area. Arising from the empty awareness, however, it just refused to be unpleasant. It was all joy. Amazing. I said to Michael afterwards that he would be a great housing support. When I think about it now, it's not the same joy, but that strong contraction is no longer there either. I think this took away a thick layer of aversion.

My mind suddenly seems to be geared towards something jhanic rather than the ground of being, after quite some time without being able to access jhanas at all. I suppose the sensible thing would be to enjoy that and see where it is heading, but for some reason I find them claustrophobic now. It\u2019s so dense and heavy and the breath is... normal. Limited. I feel trapped. And as described above, the attention feels like a giant octopus is clinging to my face, and of course getting rid of it is not only a bad idea but also impossible, since I am the darn octopus. So I guess I\u2019m being drawn into the vipassana jhanas, with an emphasis on third vipassana jhana. How I have missed that! And now that it happens, I really don\u2019t like it. I have sort of developed a taste for the lightness. This octopus is so heavy and it feels like I\u2019m not getting enough air. I realize that this is just part of the process and not something to resist, but I\u2019m not going to lie to myself and pretend that it\u2019s easy.",

I concluded this morning that decreasing the dosage to make the jar last longer was a really bad idea so I thought \"screw it\" and took the full dosage for the first time in several days. If I don't get the next jar in the mail tomorrow, I will have to temporarily increase the dosage of antidepressants (I need those chronically). Within 15-20 minutes from taking the supplement, the channels popped open and peace spread through the body. Meditating today has been such a grace. It is humbling to see just how fragile it still is, but most of all I'm grateful that the natural mind / tawa / rigpa / the ground of being is available again, discernable through the fog. It makes the world so much more beautiful. That simplistic clarity and presence - I don't want to live without it. Seriously, how did I even make it through all those years of it being clouded?

        "msg": "Today while my serotonine level was coming back to normal, it was very helpful to listen to Michael Taft's latest guided meditation on SF Dharma Collective, pointing out instructions. I could really feel that dualistic attention octupus letting go of my face, one arm at a time. What was interesting about that was that it was very obvious that it wasn't some \"other thing\" that let go from my face. I knew all the time that it wasn't something other than me, but while in that dualistic split it felt like it. The letting go, however, was very tangibly a melting back into my face. I think having experienced that in a phenomenologically clear way can be a helpful thing, because now I have a muscle memory of how it is \"done\". It's sort of the opposite movement from what the dualistically oriented mind believes it to be. I also noticed that my jaw was once again moving into its correct relaxed position, just like it did a while back. There were some other kriyas occurring as well, all correcting the body into more relaxed positions (they differ from earlier kriyas in being more precise and seemingly more directed - less jerky, more obviously functional). It's interesting to notice all this happening again. That's some kind of middle-path shift happening. This time it went through all the movements faster, as it was known terrain. Some of this has been shifting back and forth regularly, but there is also a grander shift to it that had been more stable until it temporarily shifted back due to a lack of serotonine. Now that grander shift is almost in place again. I can feel that there is still a suction cup from an octopus arm right between my eyes that is causing some remaining tention. Thankfully I now know how to relax that - I can sort of lean/rest into it and almost integrate it. The relief from doing that is a great motivator for the practice. At class today we got to play with widening the visual field and letting it mix with awareness. That's my favorite off cushion practice. Michael confirmed that seeing stuff behind one's back (and knowing stuff that shouldn't be physically possible to derive from the physical senses of the individual body) is something that happens with this practice, so it's not just me.",

        "msg": "The phenomenology around them can differ. There are many unknown events that seem fruition-like but don't have the kind of obvious effect that fruitions have, and others that seem to have some kind of clear effect but lack the clear phenomenology (they can be A&P events or maybe other insight moments). There's a grey area, and I think it's a good idea to be critical of what counts. The other ones I mentioned briefly did have both phenomenology and effect but the phenomenology was not quite as clear and the effect that came seemed to come at the same time but I didn't see the exact moment when it came so I can't tell for sure that it happened as a result of coming back online, so to speak. That's why I didn't mention them. I sort of discarded/disregarded them. When it happened again in a clearer way, they came to my recollection again as something that might be worth mentioning after all. Old path fruitions are mentioned in MCTB2, don't remember where, and I think Daniel may have mentioned them in some vimeo. They make it tricky to keep track of paths. One might think that there is a new path moment, but in reality it's just a repeat fruition from a previous path. Instead of progressing forward, one can easily call up the next nana from a previous path and continue the cycling from there. There are probably reasons for that happening. I have been wondering about that. In this case, it was obvious that I had backlashed quite a lot, so it probably took one or more previous path fruitions to come back on track. I had slipped out of the path I was on but was given a second chance. It was probably good that it happened, because it helped me to see some things more clearly. Hopefully that can make the insights of whatever path that was more stable so that I can stay on track. There is something called fruition knowledge that comes from repeating fruitions enough to mature the seed that the new path is. I always suspected that I missed out on that after path two or wherever it is that I am. I have had fruitions that seemed to be from full insight cycles more than twice but it seems like there are a much larger number of full insight cycles than there are paths, to add to the confusion as if old path fruitions didn't complicate it enough (and distinguishing between those occurrances can probably be tricky too). I do not fulfil the criteria of third path as described by Daniel, so my guess would be that I'm working towards third path.",

Was distracted and had hypnagogia basically at the same time, without being dull. That's a new one. Was not content with it as trekcho. Decided to add five minutes of regular vipassana. Papa Che is going to love this: I did noting aloud. The noting soon became less loud, though, because it very soon brought me down the stack to flow and to tawa. I tuned into tawa when available. Was distracted again, applied vipassana again. Michael Taft has recommended this, using vipassana going down the stack and tuning into awareness going up the stack. I can see why. It gets more dynamic that way, less time wasted on distractions when stuff get in the way. I will do more of this, as distractions keep coming up. Cool how fast the vipassana illustrated the unnecessary echo in getting caught up in thoughts. I probably need to work more with that echo thing with regard to thoughts, that is, larger chunks than in my earlier vipassana practice that was more focused on a micro level of sensations.",

        "msg": "Interesting. That's very similar to what happened in my lucid dream that I haven't typed in my report about here yet. Cool! --- 45 minutes of reclining meditation while ceiling-gazing. Hypnagogic swirls occurred immediately while monkey mind was still going on. I decided to not resist any sensory input including thoughts. If I intend to do the \"drop the ball\" technique I too easily slide into throwing the ball away as if it were on fire, and that causes dualistic splits and echoing and very distracting back-and-forth movements. Focusing on one object in the beginning to get concentrated isn't really my thing either. I simply don't like it. In fact, I find it incredibly boring. It actually feels great to allow myself the thoughts that I HATE shamatha. I don't mind the higher jhanas, but having to focus one-sidedly on one object - so not worth it. I don't know how representative this opinion is for me, but I don't care. I probably sound like a rookie with weak character, but I don't care. Gosh, it feels so good to tell shamatha to fuck off. I also realized that I still love vipassana, which isn't really that much about noting for me. Noting is great to start out with when the mind is utterly obstructive, but otherwise the whole thing about picking some sensation out one at a time and noticing it separately feels like such a detour. What I love is to just immerse myself in all the sensations, welcome all of them and letting them move through me, regardless of what they are and how many they are. It's like getting a massage. There is so much going on at the same time, on all levels. I can notice tawa while at the same time getting massage from flow in several different sense gates and also notice textures of phenomena and have discursive thoughts applying concepts to some stuff. There really is no reason to choose. I can do it all at the same time, or rather just let it all happen. It's vipassana and trekcho at the same time, sort of, and this is what gets me concentrated, as a biproduct. And then I can accidently get absorbed with some quality of it all and just happen to get into jhanas, if that is what wants to happen, and that's okay. I'm done with limiting the practice to some idea of what is supposed to happen. So done with it! I may change my mind about that in a couple of hours or in a few weeks or in a few months or never again. It doesn't matter. This is what feels true right now, and I'm going to say it, uncensored. The only thing that's wrong with my practice is my ideas about how it should be. Fuck it! I had a GREAT meditation. I let awareness do ceiling-gazing and whatever else it wanted to do at the same time. It did lots of stuff and I loved it. And now I'm smiling because this is actually what Daniel has been saying all along. Just take in what happens in all sense gates in the whole field. Yup. That works.",

        "msg": "I did another 40 minutes of similar practice. I also did walking meditation on my way to and from the hospital to get testd for covid. I haven't received my results yet but my partner tested positive so I probably have covid. I'll type in my hand-written report of this morning's lucid dream now. Then it's time to start a new log, because this one is getting lengthy. --- Lucid dream, although I didn't think about it as such. I had been dreaming that I had said yes to chairing a panel discussion on a conference on short notice as stand-in for someone who had been double-booked in the schedule. I thought it was mainly time-keeping and making sure that everyone got enough time to speak. Just before the session started, the professor I used to work with said that in his experience it plays out just fine as long as one has prepared good enough interview questions. That was meant as encouragement, because he took it for granted that I had. When I looked surprised and said that I hadn't prepared any questions, he put on that face that indicates that he is deeply worried. I think I may have woken up here and decided to go right back in to give the dream a happy ending in accordance with the dream logic. I said to the professor \"But the questions are right here in the text\". I don't know if it was the official abstract or some manuscript I had been given. I could only read parts of it. It indicated that different participants were to talk about different aspects of the topic at hand, using short keywords, like [name of an american professor in our network] - trust\". He acknowledged that apparently that was the case. I still had to deal with the issue that I had a much more active part to play than I had prepared for. There were several hundreds of people in the audience, including my mum and brother. Before the dream was lucid, I had also noticed that I had made myself too comfortable with regard to clothing. I had talen off my leggings and socks and shoes and had bare legs and feet under a skirt that was too short. That was also the case for my collegue E who had also jumped in on short notice to cover for another person, so at least I wasn't alone in the situation. However, when the dream went lucid, I decided that I had put the clothes back on in a break or something, and when I looked again I had them on. I realized that the dream hadn't been specific about the topic of the panel discussion or the name of the conference or the names of the participants (except for one). I really had no idea what we were supposed to talk about. The situation felt real even though I knew I was editing it. I approached it as if it was real (except for the editing). I was nervous. Just before the session was about to start, I was told that I would be the one introducing the whole thing. I thought it was a situation that called for spontaneous action / vajra speech / Shinzen's auto-talk, letting something larger than the individual me speak for me and trust that it would work. So I improvized, putting on a cordial and professional voice. I welcomed the audience to the conference and the session. I took the names from the text. I couldn't read them but I pretended that I could, acted as if in the dream I could. It worked. The names came out from my mouth. I couldn't even recall what I had said in some cases, but I approached it as if it made sense and kept going. I couldn't convince myself enough that I could read the subtitle of the session, so it wouldn't come out from my mouth. After a brief pause, waiting for it to happen, I just decided that it was good enough without it. Based on the keyword trust, I made a little speech that came out as sort of a dharma talk and phrased a question around it. This went on for a while. Then I needed to go to the bathroom and popped out of the dream. I have had so many nightmares about unprepared lectures. This was healing. It also had elements of no doer in a situation that would typically trigger the sense of a doer for me, which is something that is challenging in my practice. I'm also content that I remembered to follow what Lama Lena said about editing the dream while looking away and as if it had already happened (like kids do when they play and change the storyline, sort of), and following the dream logic. This was a stable lucid dream in which I both applied dream yoga methodology and applied other dharma teachings to work with challenges both in daily life and in my practice.",

        "msg": "I just attended a zoom research seminar about a book project at my former working place. As I entered the zoom room, I noticed that spaciousness and relatively nondual vision was readily accessible, just as I often find when I attend meetings with meditation groups and with the partner with whom I shared a morning practice routine for a while. I do feel safe in that group, so the connection to safety mentioned in my thread asking about pointers to nondual perception is interesting. What kind of shift in my approach to daily life would make me feel safe enough to let go more? I can't really wait for my life to provide safe circumstances, because it doesn't seem to work that way. Safe enough will have to suffice, and even though I'm unemployed and disabled and don't know what to do with the rest of my life, people do awaken living in caves in countries where poverty is a great problem and where fatal diseases and dangerous wild animals are common. The historical Buddha basically did, although he was poor only by choice. So I don't think that \"external\" safety is what does it. Having basic safety definitely makes it easier, though, because survival instincts trigger the ego. That's what it's for, after all. I think that it might be helpful to remember the difference between abundance perspective and scarcity perspective - not in a way that legitimates inequality (I can see how it can be twisted to imply that although my personal conclusions are about sharing instead of greedily holding on to possessions); in this context, I'm not talking about it as a theory about society at all, but as an approach for myself. To crave and cling less. Very basic Buddhist points. Like with regard to this seminar - I can focus on what a loss it is to no longer work in this incredible context, or I can focus on the blessing of still being part of the group as I'm welcome to the seminars and to workshops they will organize and they are all supportive of me writing my book and want to help with feedback and contacts with publishers and contribute to the analysis if I have data sessions. That's amazing. After a while the focus on spaciousness faded, for two reasons. One was that I wanted to take notes, because it's all both really interesting and relevant for my own book project, and my attention deficit is tangible. Maybe open awareness can be great for taking notes, but if so, I have yet to work on that skill. This reminded me that regardless of how much I subjectively prefer a broader awareness to directed attention, experiencewise, in order to function in this society I still really need to develop my attention skills. Tough shit. The other reason was that I was superfascinated by the discussion --> ADHD super focus, because - oh my Golly - we basically did vipassana on social interaction. As the empirical researchers of social interaction that we are, we jointly came to the conclusion that agency is a construct that can't actually be pinpointed anywhere if we look closely at what happens in social interaction. It's empty. We can talk about it as a formation that has relevance for other concepts that people value, with regard to autonomy, integrity, morality, social changes and so forth, but you can't define it in any consistent way or find it in the data. So instead of arguing that people with dementia do have agency, under sufficiently supportive conditions, we might as well just skip the concept altogether. Either that or make the point that whereas people often think of people with dementia as lacking agency, the truth is that nobody really has agency. It's not something that you have. It's conditioned, always, and really not of any use as an analytical concept. The professor of this group has previously rather aggressively deconstructed models for communication that assume that there is an independent doer, and I remember a manuscript in which he addressed all the ways people construct a self in social interaction (for the purpose of dementia research focusing on how everything is dependently arising, although he didn't call it that). I have been working with this professor for 19 years, in different constellations, and without knowing it, we have actually been doing empirical research on dependent origination all this time. He was actually one of the first person to introduce me to the dharma, even though he isn't into Buddhism at all. I probably should include him in lineage prayers. I find this relevant to the ongoing discussion here on DhO on realizations in Buddhism versus other traditions. Despite my background in research, I don't think that the scientific paradigm will ever be able to incorporate all planes of existance and all functioning modes of understanding reality. I think science needs to stick to its internal logic in order to accomplish what it indeed does accomplish, and that means that it needs to presuppose some kind of reference point that is beyond questioning. Like Archimedes said (translating the way I remember it in Swedish, so not a proper qoutation): give me a fixed point and I'll move the world. The fixed points may vary, but science can't operate without one (well, maybe quantum physics can - I don't know - but I have yet to see quantum physics, the actual physics rather than new age versions of it claiming to be based in it, have any significant impact on how people approach human sociality, morality, welfare politics etc, let alone spirituality in a more substantial way than anecdotal inspiration). If we want to get to the \"ultimate\" truth of reality, we can't just assume things like that. Like the existence of a material world (my opinion - YMWV). And STILL: I have been part of empirical research that really comes to conclusions that match the dharma incredibly well. It just isn't taken to any conclusions about samsara, which is of course a huge difference. Before the seminar, inbetween errands and chores, I took a break to just lay down and let go. Oh, that felt soooo good. I want to do this many many times in a day. It is great for practice momentum to do it often. My poor executive function makes it difficult for me. It is such a struggle for me just to manage to fit the basics into the hours of the day: meals, medications, feeding cats, medicating cats, doing the most necessary errands and chores, my formal practice sessions, exercise, going out during the few hours of daylight, and sleep. Somehow I must find my way back to a routine that gives enough space for my practice. It seems to me that it used to be easier, even though I had a job to do too then. The job was in several ways much less complicated than navigating the society as unemployed, but maybe I also needed less practice then? I don't know. I definitely feel like I need more practice now. Anyway, what I was going to write was a reminder to myself that jhanas actually are available now, if I can just make the time to let go. Jhanas can happen almost instantly. So maybe I just need to let go of some idea of having to do it in a specific way that needs more undivided time. It is possible to fit jhanas into a quick break, at least first jhana and maybe second. It doesn't have to be a big deal. (Oh, the Papancha...)",

This is super-obvious when wiggling on the threshold to depression while at the same time balancing a number of other neurocognitive diagnoses and some weird contested illnesses and trying to balance medications - while also dealing with changing hormones and stuff due to age and a life situation that is in several ways unstable (not in one-sidedly negative ways). I have so many d\u00e9j\u00e0 vus these days. It's like \"Oh, yeah... I remember this\" and \"Oh no, not this again\" and \"Wait a minute... when did this stop and how come I never noticed it was gone until it came back?!\" and \"Wait, did I just say that? Where did that come from?\" and \"Didn't I just say the exact opposite a moment ago?\" and \"Wow... I thought this side/tendency/ability/annoying habit/personal quirk was lost forever\" all the time. It's exhausting and interesting and sort of funny. At least I don't need to search long for anything to investigate in my practice. Edited to add: Haha! I just had a very pleasant experience of spatially deconstructing a cat litter box while peeing. Under those seconds, there were visual vibrations of the image with fractal levels, flattening, hyper-3D, pleasant waves (also with fractals), a sense of it all being me, a sense of emptiness, a sense of form and emptiness at the same time, and a sense of it all being beautiful just as it is.",

        "msg": "I can relate to what you described, but whether it's the same thing, I really have no idea. I find that it is a shift of perception, actually, but not the way I thought. I guess it depends on what we mean with perception and shift. Maybe I could describe it as a shift in perception about perception. I don't know. The word perception feels misleading to begin with. My subjective experience of what is usually referred to in common language as perception has changed. Or meta-experience has changed. Ah, I don't know. I'm not going to assume much about this, whatever it is, but explore it further. In the meantime I'm also going to get some rest. I think I prefer not attaching a label to it. While I do appreciate maps of processes a lot, I'm less inclined to name ways of being in the world. For me personally if feels like it closes the space. I prefer it to be open-ended and undefined, I think. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Olivier, as I know that you have great appreciation for theoretical precision and are a scholar of finesse. However this develops, right now I find a great relief in not feeling the need to wrestle with going back and forth between two different modes of perception. Gosh, that was painful! But the sense of duality there might come back. Time will tell if I really see this clearly enough. When I talked to Daniel yesterday, he said that this very issue and the observations we discussed were what flipped the switch for him. That does not mean that he gave me a dharma diagnosis, though, just to be clear. I'm a bit suspicious because if this is it, it seems much too easy. Also, I had some naive hopes that it would help with my difficulties in executive functioning, and so far it seems like the opposite. I have been confused all day. Somehow I find myself surprised by how office supplies and the key to my apartment look and function, and I forget my thoughts as they arise in a way that I think is new (I have had similar issues before but this feels qualitatively different). So... I don't know. I would not be surprised to find other knots for me to deal with, or this one in more depth. I sort of expect the final development to unfold in an unexpected way. I have not had a chance yet to even evaluate if my experience lives up to criteria for third path, so let's not jump to conclusions, okay? I have quite a lot of growing up to do too. If things go well, I will get the opportunity to go through cognitive behavioral therapy to deal with my avoidance/procrastination and the anxiety involved there. I think it's a good idea to stabilize my medication first, but after that. I think part 2 of Michael Taft's \"Reversing the stack\" zoom teachings will be a great opportunity to integrate stuff, because we are going from emptiness to form, integrating nondual realizations into our daily life and working through everyday life issues based on that, letting them self-liberate. There's so much to work with there that I have no worries about finding something to develop in the practice. I could definitely develop my shamatha too, and I believe that might be helpful with regard to being more useful. There will be more teachings with Lama Lena, which I look forward to. The stories she tells make it seem like anything is possible. I aim at opening up my mind, letting go of filters and biasses that make the world limited. I have promised her to go for full realization of Buddhahood or die trying. I can't think of anything more fulfilling than honoring that promise, regardless of results, and I'm trying to avoid selfbashing here because that's bad namlam according to Lama Lena.",

As far as big theories go, I still haven't found any better approach than compatibilistic determinism, which I settled for as a working hypothesis in my late teens. It says that there can only be a will at all if it's determined (conditioned). So one way to respond would be that yes, there is a choice and the choice is determined (conditioned). Don't know, though. It kind of presupposes that there is a continuous self that either gets to choose or not. Either way it gets sort of heavy. Over the years I have been thinking that it seems more skillful to assume responsibility as if there is a choice, because assuming responsibility conditions us to make more skillful choices than not doing it would. Then again, responsibility can also be overwhelming, which might lead to apathy and procrastination (all too common tendencies for me). Maybe there isn't any need for a big theory. It might be wiser to just go with what love leads to in any given moment, because they are all transient anyway. Better still would be if love could just act through me, with as little sense of me there to mess it up as possible. I want the spontaneous impulses to be out of love, always. I guess I need to keep choosing until I don't need to anymore. Does that make any sense at all?",

Had an awesome combination of shamatha and non-dual investigation practice yesterday (one at a time, following each other). There was that sense of reality turning inside out when shifting between them which I sort of like. Same reality, same perception technically (with every sensation happening where it happens and arising together with \"tags\" of pre-processed information, that is, interpretations), and yet totally different as it is all framed within an entirely different logic (that seems to happen on that pre-processing level). Fascinating. I find the non-dual framing of reality much more effortless and relaxed and less prone to self-grasping and weird tensions. Less of a code-red-alert mode. It is still not my default framing, but it's getting gradually more accessible. It probably takes a lot of practice, as I'll need to unlearn what has become habitual and I guess to some extent undo evolution (the accumulated karma). It feels like less of a knot now that I have seen that the basic mechanism is the same. It's not some wonderous skill that needs to be added, basically \"just\" some hardwired mammalian survival insticts that need to get less trigger happy in order to uncover a way of being that it less conditioned and thereby more primordial (sure, that's the Tibetan cave yogi influence talking, and that's an interpretation too). I started a daily practice late in life, so there's a lot of habituation to let go of. My neurodivergent wiring makes some aspects easier to let go of as I never really embraced them, but it also makes some aspects extremely hard-wired. There are theories that some of the features of these diagnoses are survival mechanisms manifested at the extreme end, and that kind of makes sense. I find that they are fighting for their own survival now. For instance, there's a new flare of tics which is basically separation fighting for its existence. I think I'm somewhat less prone to fight it back now and somewhat more prone to let it play out its karma. Repression is not an option. Inviting spaciousness over and over again is. Relating to the three kayas is. Emotions can be worked with from the basis of that, by just being with them and letting them find their own rainbow nature, the inherent joy and compassion that actually seems to be the initial driving force for them all when you let them unpack. I'm not saying that's any ultimate reality, but it seems to be closer to it from where I stand, and it's definitely something that makes things more functional for me. I can probably spend the rest of my life working on this.",

Not sure what is practice related or simply dealing with my wiring together with winter depression. In my teens I read a story about a realm where people went by their daily business as usual but as soon as they didn't actively think of their stuff, like an umbrella or a shopping bag or a lunch sandwich they were eating, it would immediately vanish. It was supposedly a realm for people to gradually learn to let go. It kind of feels like I'm there, with the stuff not only being material possessions but also thoughts, feelings, impulses, ideas, some habituated knowledge. Being confused and forgetful is far from new, but the scope and rapidness of it might be. I find myself looking closely at my stapler, finding its existence something of a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and wondering if it always looked like that and having to relearn how to refill it. Lots of things like that, and also lots of stuff popping up and vanishing right away without latching on to anything. Like a whole popcorn factory of fragmentary impressions. On the other hand, there are awesome lifesaving reflexes that I had no idea were there. I could have broken my neck yesterday or hit my head as I slipped and was about to relentessly fall down from a steep slippery rock, and I found myself jumping and running downhill fast until I reached flat ground without falling or even straining an ancle. My formal practice yesterday was very calm, like just hanging out in the space and taking a break from all the impressions. Yet there was movement. Wavy, swirly, spiralling movement. Smooth. Little conceptualization. A sense of empty clarity, clarity without anything there to be clear about. Just sitting in timelessness and being fine with it.",

Lama Lena's pointing out shifted things for me very tangibly. --- There is something about the flipping over from \"dual\" framing of perception to \"non-dual\" framing that catches my interest (talking about it in simplistic terms here). I find that there are specific turning points when the framing shifts. Phenomenologically they feel like reality is turned inside out. Sometimes this seems to manifest partially, with one of the senses only and with a remaining assumed center that thinks that it watches it happen (even though the assumptions are just embedded as tags in the sensations). Other times it just flips over entirely, pretty much like a spinning toroid. It's still the same reality but sort of seen from an angle that we couldn't expect. It's not coming from any direction, but from inside experience itself. It unfolds as if it would swallow itself and push out from the other end. That's fascinating.",

I had a chat with Michael Taft who offered to give some pointers and wanted to talk during the upcoming week. He thinks that it's time for me to build a personal connection to a Bodhisattva of choice, to ask for guidance. I love it. I'm so fed up with scientific materialism that I could puke all over it, almost, lol. He also gave some great advice on dealing with depression, having to do with generating energy together with leading the energy to meditation and other skillful activities so that the depressed mode doesn't use it all up for rumination and stuff. Then I watched Lama Lena's public live teachings, and what do you know - she taught about depression practice. And then I found two supporting comments here in my log, both with great pointers too. I feel so cared for by the universe! The sadhana feels like it has gotten its juice back and my central channels are online and the nada sound is loud. For the time being I feel at peace. I have no doubt that the depression will pose new challenges. I wouldn't be surprised if I wake up tomorrow morning with brain fog and inflammatory pain.

        "msg": "I get that. I used to be so in love with the practice that I couldn't understand how anyone could possibly not feel motivated enough to keep going, but depression takes the juice out of everything including meditation - in many short pulses that we are habitually lured into solidifying, just like you said. It's so devious, because even though I know that all phenomena are transient, there's this huge blob of apathy that says \"so what?\", and just slipping into oblivion is so tempting. I always do some practice, but sometimes it feels like I'm just doing my time. Thankfully I got so many eye openers yesterday that I feel that it would be foolish to neglect them. I managed to get up this morning and do my sadhana and try to connect to Avalokiteshvara (how does one do that?) and sit. I also did the Tibetan depression treatment. It's supposed to work with karma, and I can see lots of ways that dependent origination gets involved in a way that has positive spin-off effects. It's a very simple practice, but I can see how habituation could easily ruin it, and if the depression is deep enough, it's impossible. I am to go outside for a walk every day, and on at least three different occasions on that walk find a being that seems happy. Then I'll think, feel and say out loud \"How wonderful that this being is so happy! I wish all beings could experience such happiness.\" Just that. I'm allowed to use a phone or something as an alibi for talking to myself, lol. It's a long-term thing, so it's building new habits of getting out to the elements of nature, getting some air and daylight and exercise, focusing on something other than me and my misery, opening up to happiness in the world, rejoicing in the happiness of other beings and wishing all beings well. It's kind of brilliant. I thought I would have to search for a long time today, because it was one of those gray and muddy days when everything looks like you are in limbo, but I got lucky after a few steps. There's a big playground close to my apartment, and some kids were out playing with their daddy. Then I went to a walking trail where people often walk their dogs in all weathers, and finding happy dogs isn't that hard. I also met a young woman who was on the phone laughing, and I walked past some horses that were either running around happily or being territorial and chasing each other away (I added some extra dogs just in case). I love seeing others being happy. It is so much easier than trying to be happy myself, so because I don't have to, suddenly I am. Sneaky. Then I had disability housing support, which was exhausting, and I had an allergic reaction to foods that I thought would be really safe, so I had to lie down in darkness for a long time because of the overwhelm that was triggered. Earlier shifts in my practice took away most of my triggers for sensory overload (having to do with my neurodivergence) but for some reason they seem to be back now. I remember Andromeda sharing that it had gone back and forth several times for her because the practice does help but also increases the sensory input. Anyway, I did some reclining meditation while lying there in the darkness, and I got into the territory of lucid light sleep. I could hear myself sleep-breathing/snoring and at the same time I could feel lots of energetic disentangling happening. I'll try to focus on Avalokiteshvara again before I fall asleep. I'm still too overwhelmed to do mantras (the sound of the vacuum cleaner was more than I could take today even though I have a rather silent one; I guess I'll have to start using hearing protectors again) so I'll have to find some other way.",

        "msg": "Yesterday: Did Lama Lena's depression practice and then 75 minutes of yin yoga and 75 minutes of \"slow flow yoga\", and it made me more present to the moment. I came into the territory where the boundaries between external sight and mental images get fuzzy. The mental images of the body in the room became so strong that I could see it behind closed eye lids as if my eyes were half-open in an unfocused way. I checked many times if my eyes were open or not, because I couldn't tell from just seeing the image. I investigated the field where inner and outer seeing overlapped. When I came home I did a smoke offering ceremony, starting with taking refuge and generating Bodhicitta, as part of my attempts at connecting with Chenrezig following the advice from Michael. I didn't do it entirely by the book, because I realized too late that I was supposed to do the thing with a fancy liquid in a bompa and use a dorje and bell while reading the text and sprinkle liquid over the offerings. I played some singing bowls instead. I also probably didn't get the offering mudras for the different elements right, and I had to look up the syllables that I was supposed to visualize. The episode with the smoke alarm wasn't according to plans either, lol. I loved the smell, though, and it helped set the mood. I used two kinds of resin (Gum Dammar and Dragon Blood, both from Goloka), juniper twigs, palo santo wood, a dried eucalyptus leaf (from a birthday bouquet from a loved one), some white sage, some lavender (dried flower from my patio) and some dried elderberry flowers. After that I did both sitting meditation (trekcho) and reclining meditation (shamatha), and then my sadhana. It raised so much energy that I could barely sleep at all. I didn't expect that in the midst of a depression. Today: Did a morning sit of trekcho with rather little hindrances coming up, except for the cat that keeps insisting on going in and out all the time, lol. Did the depression practice (love it). Meditation happened on its own when I was outside. Tensions fell away and there were silky sensations in my lips and entire face and reality turned itself inside out - not in the most tangible and abrupt way that happens in formal practice when concentration and clarity are high enough for the phenomenology to stand out so strongly, but more like gentle flowy figure-ground shifts. I sat down on a rocky hill to just be with it. After a while I did the Chenrezig practice there too. It's one of those places where reality seems more alive because it's a piece of nature that hasn't been messed with as much. I find it healing. Yet it overlooks a playground and some sports' areas and pathways where people walk, so there are plenty of opportunities for Brahmaviharas. In the late afternoon I did some reclining meditation that turned into lucid light sleep with short passages of non-lucid dreaming intermittently. Then in the evening I did a two hour yoga session with shaking meditation and spontaneous motion built in, together with moon salutations, and later my sadhana. --- My connecting with Chenrezig has so far included the practice that we do in the Chenrezig group (like metta with visualizations and mantra), chanting in both Tibetan and Sanskrit, evoking, altar rituals, prostrations, smoke offering, and visualizing and \"feelizing\" Chenrezig's presence.",

About an hour of sitting which involved shamatha with and without an object and going back and forth between emptiness and form. Today: Short trekch\u00f6d sitting. Tibetan depression treatment. Yoga: shaking, soft vinyasa, yin, shavasana. Did a daily karma checklist specifically designed for the way my personal karma sneaks up on me. The idea is to make it easier to build skillful habits and avoid old routes of bad habits, by working with subtle stuff. I need to do it in a compassionate way that doesn't set off defenses. In the list I encorporated what I learned from experimenting with a sattvic implementation tool earlier, and old strategies for dealing with issues related to my wiring. I also built on later observations of how chains of reactions on subtle levels limit my daily life, as I keep tripping over myself. I usually don't log that stuff, because then I wouldn't have time to do anything but logging. Evening: zhine without an object, together with the cat that usually interrupts those sessions. So that's how to do it! After a day full of subtle resistance to just letting go of planning and other thoughts that insisted on latching on to each other and keep spinning (at least I noticed it over and over again), it was suddenly so easy to just surrender in a reclining position together with a huge purring cat. There was disentangling, beyond concepts, and I had a bunch of those little unknowing events that are very close to being distinguishable as cessations, except they don't really feel like they are accompanied with new realizations. Instead they seem to take me back to a baseline that I had gradually clogged up as hindrances surfaced again. My hypothesis is that they are cessations from a previous path that needs refreshing because karma keeps bringing me back to old habits. In this session, I could see a pattern for when they occurred: as a culmination of something disentangling. After this had been going on for a while, with a number of disentangling processes, there was an instance of \"falling down\" which was then followed by a strong sense of normality coming back. I recognized it both from the Chenrezig practice and from many previous times when I felt like I was spitted out from something formless. I think falling down to the heart is not really new, but what is new is that I resist it less. This time, instead of assuming that I was spitted out from something and getting back to an ordinary mindset, I decided to just rest where I was without assuming so much about where that was. It turned out to be very peaceful. I had some lucid light sleep and then woke up rejuvinated. In the beginning of the session I opened up to Chenrezig/Avalokiteshvara emotionally and with some visualization, mantra and prayer. Have done microhits during the day. Will do the sadhana and trekch\u00f6d before going to sleep, unless a job application makes it impossible.",

I'm not jumping to conclusions about what causes what. It seems to be intertwined and probably more complex than a linear causal relation. I wonder to what extent this can be disentangled. Some aspects are manipulable, and applying mindfulness there has ripple effects. The fascia around hips, seat bones and pelvis seems to have a central role in this. So far I have been doing Yi rang, the Tibetan depression treatment, every day since I started. It feels liberating emotionally. I really don't need happiness to be about me.",

Thus she has assembled stuff from two different texts. It works. The symbolic level resonates well with my subconscious processings. There were lots of releases from the second round too. It seems like my fascia is letting go of stuff, and I think this is the first morning this winter that I'm waking up without anxiety (one of the very few anyway). Wow, I had forgotten what that feels like. So light. So peaceful. There's joy there too, and so much space. I actually have energy. This reminds me of the miraculous healing that took place when I started my practice. I think I need a practice that stirs up shit and disentangles it, and as usual, the subconscious does a better job with that than the regular processing patterns. The ng\u00f6ndro seems to kickstart the subconscious processings, and those are more fluent in Sambhogakaya stuff.",

It makes things happen energetically and physically, not to mention psychologically. It makes rigpa accessible in the midst of this fairly mild but stubborn depression. It cuts through the anxiety and raises energy. It makes things light. The nada sound is loud. There is space and lightness and smoothness. As for the tech, I like how the mantra chanting feels in my body, vibrationally, and I like how the rhythm draws me in and how overtones develop as I relax. That captures my attention and maintains it until I'm one with it. I also like that whenever some junk pops up, that's part of the practice. It transforms into maggots and other creepy crawlies that go out through my eliminatory orifices and into the center of the earth where Yamantaka, slayer of death, takes great pleasure in devouring them as delicious treats. They are not something to get rid of, just misplaced energy that is liberated. After the practice I took a walk, doing the Ri Yang/Yang Ri/whetever that Tibetan exercise for depression is called. I was still in Trekch\u00f6d, and at the same time, the mantra and the purification were still going on at some other level, and it was all of the same taste.

        "msg": "That sounds really tough. I'm sorry to hear that. Are you saying that the digging up of your baggage somehow resulted in the deaths of the lamas and your father, or that it was karmically intertwined (beyond simple notions of cause and effect), or that the deaths just happened on top of everything else that had already been challenging enough? Just trying to get the story straight. For the record, I had years of dark night before starting a formal practice, as part of a huge life crisis, and at the time I was convinced that I was a jinx because as soon as I thought that the worst had gone by and that I could actually dare to be happy, someone close to me would develop a fatal disease or die or something. I don't believe that I caused it. I know now that I'm not a jinx. The universe sure seems to find ways to scream at me when I fail to listen to the process, though, so I guess I don't entirely rule out some large-scale entanglement on the symbolic level. I'm not as afraid of what it might dig up as of having to live with not digging it up. That said, I'll continue to do my best to pace it in a way that I can handle. Don't you think that if you could have awakened in a smoother way, you would have? I would have to start reciting much faster in order to reach 100000 recitings in less than a year. I'm not sure that would be such a great idea. It seems like it could get pretty frantic. I think I'll try to use the rhythm and pace that maintains a balance of energy and equanimity. It may vary over time exactly what that means, and subtle changes might make huge differences. None of the teachers I turn to for help are in denial about spiritual challenges or emergencies, and the process has its own ways of telling me what is needed and what should be avoided. Lama Lena has been very clear about some seemingly subtle differences in do:s and don't:s. Apparently visualizing light in the wrong tone of warmth can make things go haywire, for instance. I can actually see that happening, because visualizing light move through all the energy channels clearly sets things in motion.",

I was able to do it, and I'm grateful for that. My other practices are very useful tools in this regard. The Vajrasattva practice makes my mind more still and open and sets some energy free that has been tied up in neuroses. The Yi Rang makes it easier to tune into joy by way of opening up to what is outside myself, which actually isn't that separate. I don't find any difference between other beings' joy and my joy when I'm able to tune into it. It's just joy happening. And since I do tune into that every day, the body remembers the okayness that comes with that recognition. For the shamatha with an object part I used the nada sound as that is very accessible at the moment. The combination of nada sound and finding the soft spot of wellbeing in it felt very fruitful. It made focusing on it much less tight, and a less tight focus does it better justice. The wideness of it is very rich and nuanced and suggestive and full of potential. It's the dance between Dharmakaya and Sambhogakaya right there. It's open potential and creation, the cosmic lovemaking. Because of the nine hours' time difference together with the lack of light here, I was soooo tired during the class. Thus the energy during the meditation was fluctuating a bit, especially during the shamatha without an object part. Some dreaminess arose. Metaawareness kept coming back online, though, and it was accompanied by brightness as it came back online. I guess that's a visual manifestation of release of energy when the tightness of getting caught up in something is released. I forgot to mention an off-cushion observation yesterday: while I was doing the Yi Rang, which involves talking out loud, I also made a metacomment to myself. I noticed that one of the bonus cases of happy beings encounters (anything more than three is a bonus) was actually a parent-child constellation that I had encountered earlier on my walk and already counted. I commented on that loud with words (since I was already talking), saying spontaneously that it still counted. Then I noticed an exchange of proto-replies (not fully verbalized) between different aspects of self that popped up, rationalizing why it would count. New occasion, it just feels so good, bonus anyway, we are newborn any given moment so they were technically not the same beings... and then there was an apparent unanimity that felt/looked/sounded like (all at once) a bunch of me:s nodding to each other and giving brief overlapping affirmative verbal responses and then sort of melting into one. It all happened very fast.",

Two half hour morning sits in which I started by getting grounded in sensory experience and then rested in the ground of being, letting sensory expressions flow through me. Some tied up energy was liberated into warm spaciousness. Then yi rang, which I find raises Bodhicitta. Then about an hour of reclining practice, surrendering and letting the process do its thing. There were some rather fierce kriyas, having to do with trauma coming to the surface: surges of adrenaline making the body jump and shake, and twitches in the face, hands and feet. They passed through quickly. Before the kriyas started arising, there were what felt like a few little explosions in the brain. Then 45 minutes of trekch\u00f6d, and then zoom group meeting with the Reversing the stack class, and then live teachings by Lama Lena on The flight of the Garuda, working with perceptions. In replying to people\u2019s questions, she described kriyas (flickering eye lids in that case) as something that bruises the tsa if it becomes a regular thing. She said that it arises because one is trying to look at the ground of being from the outside rather than being it, and she adviced to interrupt the practice session if one gets stuck in it. I didn\u2019t do the ng\u00f6ndro until past midnight, so technically on the Sunday. I did only 54 rounds of the Vajrasattva mantras. Sunday Jan 24th, 2021 A soft vinyasa yoga Brahmani style. I could feel that my channels were squeeky but gradually cleaning up. More energy and less depressive mood than yesterday. There was some joy. Then the ng\u00f6ndro (54). Then Yi Rang. Then breaking patterns by reading dharma instead of soothing myself with netflix and easy games on my ipad. I\u2019m reading Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche on the Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep, which I find contains excellent pointers for how to approach life with more awareness and presence. Reading it brings out spaciousness, and so does applying it. It seems like my avoidance behavior is mainly driven by feelings of overwhelm. I notice that I tend to flee into activities that are both undemanding and have a short time span with natural breaks and then repeat it over and over again, whereas there\u2019s stuff that I would really like to do but procrastinate because it feels like too much because it\u2019s more long term and I will need to organize it into smaller chunks on my own. That\u2019s a karmic pattern that I really need to break. Chenrezig group practice in the evening. Monday, Jan 25th, 2021 Woke up relatively early without the heaviness. Extremely stressful day with regard to daily life challenges, but when I remembered to look for it, the light spaciousness was there. There\u2019s a learning curve here, I guess, as for remembering that.

        "msg": "Tuesday Jan 26th, 2021 Yi Rang Yin yoga Vajrasattva ng\u00f6ndro (108) Wednesday Jan 27th, 2021 Extremely early morning: Reversing the stack class. We went from shamatha with an object gradually into vipashyana on an emotion. As an object for shamatha I used the 100 syllable Vajrasattva mantra, which might be considered a somewhat weird object for shamatha because it moves so much, but my ADHD brain loved it. Not boring! The first few rounds I vocalized the mantra and then I let it play out mentally. Since I am chanting this mantra in my ng\u00f6ndro, it was very vivid. Very soon it shifted from shamatha into MIND recognizing itself with an intense clarity, like WHOOOSH, and as I kept going back to the mantra, it sort of investigated itself, seeing itself using all the sense gates and being there so vividly and at the same time so utterly rainbowlike. So much there and so much not there at the same time and yet neither of them, or rather... both the both and the neither, if that makes any sense. Not as two separate things and not as one thing, and a meta-level of that too. I\u2019m sure this is the \u201done taste\u201d. So when we were supposed to go to the next step, vast spacious awareness, I had already gone through the whole sequence to vipashyana and started over again. That made it easier for me to follow the instruction and \u201ddrop the ball\u201d, bacause my autistic brain was already mentally prepared for the whole sequence and didn\u2019t construct the two kinds of shamatha as distinct things. Thus two of the steps that I tend to trip over because of how I\u2019m wired could now be taken smoothly. Thankyou Vajrasattva! I went from vast spacious awareness to noticing slipping into constructing the vsp as an object and noticing the noticing of it, which then becomes vsp, several times. The emptiness of that whole sequence stood out, which is vipashyana. When the intensity of that snapped me out from \u201dthe view\u201d, I went back to the mantra for a little while, and then the sequence would unfold on its own again. So when it was time to pick an emotion to do vipashyana on, it was already very clear what that would entail - the nonmethodology of it, sort of. A feeling had already arisen just a moment before the instruction came, so that was an easy choice. Subtle frustration. One of my cats wanted to go outside and was trying to get my attention. Letting awareness be with that subtle frustration and see the emptiness of it was very helpful. I could not but smile - I have seen this reoccuring thing as such a problem, and it\u2019s really a resource. There\u2019s a refreshing aliveness in the subtle frustration. The emotion kept coming back in pulses and the emptiness kept revealing itself over and over again. As my cat was getting more desperate, the frustration pulses went from subtle to non-subtle, and the non-subtle frustration had a refreshing aliveness too. The joy from this snapped me out from \u201dthe view\u201d because the ego took the credit from awareness and felt so pleased with itself and made stories about it. Right after that, Michael ended the meditation. Before doing this meditation, we had been talking among other things about emptiness and suchness/thusness. I also learned that luminosity just means that something is aware. Well, good, then that box is ticked. People really mix up all sorts of things when they use that word. I have sort of been wondering whether it\u2019s that awareness of something being aware sort of on its own where it is, or whether it is some very vivid version of the suchness/thusness, or both at the same time, or something other that I haven\u2019t picked up on yet. So it is the first of those. Right. Good. That totally aligns with how Lama Lena uses the word. Note to self: the recording of this class is well worth coming back to, because it puts a lot of things into place.",

        "msg": "Later that wednesday, after the Yi Rang, I did a short sit out in the nature on a little hill, one of those places where boundaries sort of fall away automatically and there's a sweet sense of centerlessness. I was drawn into centerlessness on and off during the day. When resting, that roaring silence that feels qualitatively different to the nada sound, abysslike but not as scary as that sounds, was there again. It appeared a few times. I wanted to throw myself into it but didn't quite manage to do so. It was more like I was hovering over it, getting used to the idea. I also did \"yogalates\" (a fusion of yoga and pilates) and yin yoga. The mantra was with me quite a lot but I failed to do the ng\u00f6ndro. I procrastinated it until I was too tired and fell asleep with my clothes on. I think yin yoga is good for my practice, but it's the opposite of energizing, so it would be better to do it in my pyjamas after brushing my teeth and after the ng\u00f6ndro. Yesterday I did the ng\u00f6ndro (108) and the Yi Rang and some additional mantra chanting. I read dharma litterature and listened to the dharma. I tried to do some zhine but fell asleep. I had taken my allergy shots, and they usually make me sleepy and dull for several days, and I was already in a bit of a jet lag before that. Earlier that day, while walking through heavy snow to the hospital, I caught myself being narrowmindedly focused on the effort of walking fast uphills in the snow in the biting cold and yet too hot and sweaty because of all the clothes that kept the heat trapped inside. I remembered that awareness is so much wider than that and that I don't have to be all focused on my body and its limitations. I decided to feel the forest instead, peacefully covered in new snow and brilliantly beautiful and still. That helped. Today I feel low and dull and very tired. When I try to meditate reclining because I can't really manage to sit up, I slip into dreaming mode. I'll go for a walk to do my Yi Rang. Hopefully that will make a difference. The sun just came out in the snowy landscape, so finding some happy beings seems quite possible. Then I will see to it that I meditate sitting up.",

There was one of those possible impermanence cessations, marked with a sound as if turning some electric equipment back on. I kept resting in awareness. Then there was another one, less demarcated than the previous one. After that I slipped into dreamlike territory. I can no longer remember the scenes. At some point I heard myself sleepbreathing. Yi Rang.

        "msg": "Vajrasattva ng\u00f6ndro count: January 31st - 54, February 1st - 54. I\u2019m starting to think that \u201done taste\u201d is more accessible to me than I habitually believe, and that I habitually tense up even though I really don\u2019t need to because somehow I tend to think (again habitually) that it's inevitable. When I bother to... stop bothering to tense up... it is there. Unless I fail to take care of my health. That can't be relaxed away. It could probably be bypassed if I had stronger concentration, but in many cases it seems like it would be wiser to just take care of this body, even though its needs can seem like something from \"The princess and the pea\". Anyway, with the little concentration I have available in this phase, doing shamatha on the breath while having tartar buildup scraped away at the dentist's, was very helpful. That old \"nimitta embryo\" popped up several times. It's funny how I thought that was something significant earlier on. It's seems more like those little signs that pop up in some video games to give a beginner player some confirmation that they are going in the right direction at all. Still, it was enough to make a difference. I did a reclining guided Michael Taft meditation in the afternoon (resting in awareness of the breath). I got sleepy eventually, but there was some very welcome unclenching of the fascia (?) in my left wrist. I try to do the Praise to the 21 Taras at dawn and dusk. Lama Lena described it as magick that comes with a failsafe. One could explain it (away) as working symbolically with one's own subconscious, but I prefer to not box it into a story. It makes a difference for me. I don't need to make up stories of why it does. Nor do I need to measure and pinpoint exactly what difference it makes. I enjoy it anyway. It's beautiful. Prayers saved my ass many many times when I was young, but those prayers did not come with a failsafe. For me the saying \"Be careful what you ask for\" is experientially true, so I love it when there is tech available that has been time-tested for oopses. I find that the healing energy that was often available around stream entry is available again. I can feel it work through my energy body. That's how I conceptualize something anyway.",

        "msg": "This night between Feb 2nd and Feb 3rd: Vajrasattva ng\u00f6ndro (108) and then Reversing the stack class. I can see why it's a good idea to go through the entire mala with the 100 syllable mantra and the visualizations, that is 108 times. It can take me from A&P through all the dukkha nanas to EQ. Of course, I'm mixing paradigms when I talk about a tantric practice in terms of Theravadan maps, but pragmatically it works. I suspect that it's not a coincidence that this specific part of the ritual has that length and the tendency to accomplish exactly that - especially since it starts with Vajrasattva and his consort unifying in bliss which leads to a purifying shower flushing creepy crawlies out from the channels (not to be wasted but to feed Yamantaka) and is followed by what seems to symbolize conformity knowledge, change of lineage and path and then cessation. The ng\u00f6ndro is basically ritual magick manifesting the entire map - poetically, symbolically, dramaturgically, viscerally... in a very juicy way. Literally. It's kind of cool. Even the lower nanas are there. Well, mind and body isn't presented as dualistically, but there is lots about causes and effects and about impermanence and suffering before we come to the 100 syllable mantra part. Not self is more implied than explicit, I'd say, but it's definitely there. In the class Michael gave a lecture on the nine vehicles and explained how they relate to each other, so there was no time for meditation.",

I look forward to that, actually. Happy distracting thoughts are a luxury, coming from an abyss of grey sticky fog and mud and stinging toxic waste. The drive to meditate is back.

        "msg": "The ng\u00f6ndro yesterday evening got very intense. Lots of piti, and during the 100 syllable mantra (108 times) there was a sense of being drawn into a very bright and high-energy vast emptiness. At the same time, it was as if that intense vast emptiness was inside my head. It reminded of being close to fainting. I think it was similar to what happened early in my practice, the time when I freaked out for a couple of days and interrupted my meditation over and over again because of panic. This time I wasn't afraid, though. I just kept going. Something loosened in my chest, and suddenly my chest voice came through with loud volume. I have never really developed my chest voice because when I was young I took lessons in classical song technique and thus worked with my head voice. Wow, the chest voice really vibrates in the chest instead of in the head. It felt as if I was chanting through my heart while having the entire space in my head. I have never been high on drugs but I suspect it would be somewhat similar. Today I have had a headache. I don't know if it's related to medication (too high dosage?) or to meditation (too intense?) or to something else. I sat to meditate outside for a while (shamatha on the breath that developed into shamatha without an object as the awareness got absorbed with itself), after doing the Yi Rang, but had to go home and lay down. I did Michael Taft's latest guided meditation (a more elaborated version of what I had already done), which loosened tensions in my head and neck and possibly some more parts of the body. There were some mild kriyas.",

I also love her straightforwardness and humor. That may not be anyone's cup of tea, as she can be pretty outspoken, but it sure is mine. --- Did some more shamatha on the breath, reclining, trying my best to soften my focus and let the breath know itself as it does anyway.

        "msg": "You're welcome, Sam. --- Yesterday: 33 minutes of shamatha on the breath, praising of Tara at dawn and dusk, group meeting with the Reversing the stack class, Vajrasattva ng\u00f6ndro (54), 90 minutes of trekch\u00f6d, teachings on the elements by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, then fell asleep during beginning of Yamantaka empowerment by Garchen Rinpoche, which was probably for the best as I'm not ready for that practice anyway (but oh, that's a soothing voice to fall asleep to). Today: shamatha sitting on a bench outside (Vajrasattva mantra and breath and wide visual rest; some visual effects), and reclining shamatha listening to Rob Burbea's jhana retreat; piti not very strong. Low day, flat sort of. The shamatha was pleasant anyway. I was tuning into the breath in the energy body. I also practiced noticing when I push the shamatha, which shows in subtle bodily tensions. Evening: Chenrezig group practice (still flat, less pleasant). Listened to Mahamudra teachings by Lama Lena, worried a bit that I'm mixing Dzogchen and Mahamudra, which Lama Lena says that you can't do until you have achieved \"one taste\" (which I have glimpses of but have far from stabilized), because Michael Taft works with what might be described as the common denominator of both. On the other hand, he does neither of them, strictly speaking. Also, Lama Lena says that you should do Mahamudra with something that you can throw away as the object for zhin\u00e9, such as a pebble, not the breath. Thus, shamatha on the breath wouldn't count according to her classification. After the teachings I did the Vajrasattva ng\u00f6ndro (108). Visualizations were difficult this time, except for the mandala of people around me and the dissolving of it into me as Vajrasattva (which gives pleasant shivers for some reason; maybe part of me still wants to join the Borg).",

I remember that I liked it a lot back then. Now I did not. There was nothing wrong with the exercises per se, but they did not work well for me with a depressed mindset. Directed attention without joy is what creates \"the attention octopus\". I was to imagine breathing from various points of the body, and it felt like an alien was trying to burst out from those points. Not pleasant at all, but educational, I guess. At least I knew that it was just attention, so I didn't freak out when the breathing felt all cramped up. Hm, that sounds like a \"cause and effect\" thing. On which path though? Anyway, then nerves in my left foot were burning so hard that it took the juice out of the practice. Maybe it actually hurts less and thereby is less distracting to do shamatha sitting than reclining after all. I probably squeeze the nerve higher up when lying in shavasana, because that's when the pain appears.",

However, it is all too easy to procrastinate it far too long. I couldn't understand how the depression could keep getting worse and worse. Then I woke up this morning feeling sick and brain foggy and with pain basically everywhere and totally exhausted and with no drive to do anything but just sleeping forever - and suddenly remembered that I used to feel like that all the time before picking up such a regular yoga regime. I was chronically fatigued. Ang going nuts with yoga took that away. So I dragged my ass out of the bed and did a yoga session from youtube, a mild one because ouch, and it helped. Brain fog gone. Breathing okay. Pain much reduced. Nada sound loud and clear. Then I booked lots of classes at the yoga studio. Suddenly booking things didn't feel like it would completely overwhelm my executive functioning. I was also able to do some other minor tasks that I had been dreading. It's that simple.

        "msg": "After the Yi Rang I sat outside for a while, doing trekch\u00f6d. In the afternoon I did Vinyasa yoga at the yoga studio and now I feel distinctly more alert. After that I sat for an hour. First 20 minutes were devoted to body sensations and the 3 C:s in them. For the rest of the session I included the visual field (with closed eyes) and listening inwardly, mainly nada sound, on top of that. I need to ramp up my sensory clarity again. I don't think I'm done with the doing. Old habitual patterns are still too strong. I think I need to actively undo them. It is still easier for my mind to engage with sensory impressions than to disangage with remanining clarity. The disengaging with clarity is a grace that seems to happen when enough work is regularly put into maintaining focused investigation. I decided today that I don't have to follow a Tibetan Buddhist path. I'm too pragmatic to follow rules and commit completely to instructions from a Lama (heh, look at that! I have finally managed to be pragmatic in some sense - that's a life goal fulfilled). The process communicates to me through sensory experience, so that's where I need to have my main commitment. Also, the Tibetan go to method for someone who isn't done with the doing would be Tantra, and that is not something that works for me in all conditions. I prefer exploring what is there to imagining and manifesting stuff. I definitely don't mind learning some of that, but it can't be my main practice. Therefore I will take a short break in my ng\u00f6ndro, to explore if I'm better off without it for now. It has to be something that I feel drawn to, not a duty. I find that it varies a lot for me but that there's too much of a tendency for me to procrastinate doing it, so when I finally get around to doing it, I'm tired and should have gone to sleep already. It is time consuming, requires temporal and spatial logistics that are beyond my current capacity, and it takes away time from my other practices. I need to have a default practice that can easily be done under any circumstances, and I need to be open to what the process communicates to me. The process is my main teacher. It doesn't charge anything if I listen to it, but it costs too much when I don't. The nada sound is loud now. Breathing is pleasant. My mind and body are at ease.",

The silky slow spiralling breath has been with me through the day, accompanied by smooth creamy piti, like the silky foam on a Guiness (that I can't drink anymore due to gluten intolerance and histamine intolerance to the yeast ). I started the day with a very short yoga session. Meditated before lunch, mainly enjoying the breath. I don't feel like labelling it as shamatha or anything else. I'm kind of fed up with names. I just did what wanted to be done. I did praise Tara and do the Yi Rang, and the altar routine. As usual I made my cats stop fighting by chanting Om mani padme hung (remarkably effective). No ng\u00f6ndro. Had a yoga class at the studio. It was heavenly. I even felt those champagne bubbles in my body that I used to have almost all the time. How I have missed those! I have no idea how temporary this grace is. I know that I very recently wrote in this log that I felt good, but after that I hit rock bottom or something. I don't know if there are more rock bottoms to come soon. At this very moment I feel healthier than I have for a long time (not sure about the time perspective; it's just what it feels like right now) and I even have a hard time understanding how things could feel so heavy as recent as yesterday morning before the yoga. It felt like I was dying, almost. Transient stuff. Weirdly transient. But definitely requiring medication. I chatted a bit with Forrest Knutson. He replies fast to comments on his videos. I got to learn that whereas 3-7 breaths per minute results in heart resonance, slower breaths than that result in something of a counter-resonance. Both are very good for our health. I'm a very slow breather by nature, while in relaxation. I breath 1,5 breaths per minute. His exercise with 3 breaths per minute felt a bit stressful to me, so I asked him to do slower ones too (he has some very helpful exercise videos that are easy to follow and that don't contain any unnecessary atmospheric bling-bling that would drive you nuts after a while). It's not Buddhist, but what he talks about can very easily be translated into Daniel-speak. Totally different terminology but goodenough phenomenology to know exactly what he's talking about. I'll soon go to bed with a slow breathing exercise video. Apparently the audio speed on youtube can be adjusted, so I can slow it down. There's no talking in the exercise once it gets going, just tones indicating inbreath and outbreath, so it won't sound funny. Of course I can breath slowly without guidance, but I like the feedback. It also makes it easier to notice changes in the breath.",

Interventions can be a trap. I find that for me there is a cycling to it. After taking the explorations to an extreme, I need to go back to just surrendering. I have actually felt that need lately, although I haven't written much about it. Can't do it without yoga, though. Tried to rest from that, very soon was back in total fatigue, pain and brain fog. I think I messed up my energy body quite a lot all those years of overcompensating stuff before I got my diagnoses. It's healing, but there is a very narrow span that I need to stay within in order for it to have the space for healing, and that span keeps moving. I started this day with one and a half hours of space element yoga. It was a recording from one of the classes I took recently, the one that I reported brough the champagne bubbles back. It had that effect this time too, but not in an A&P way. It's just very spacious, and I can feel that it allows energies to flow freely in my body. They hadn't been stuck in contraction for long now, so it's less carbonated, so to speak. More gently flowing. I think lots of sparkling is a sign that space is opening up after too much contraction with pressure building up. If there is enough space on a regular basis, it doesn't build up like that. Thus I can stop being nostalgic about the high amount of champagne bubbles. They were just a signpost that I needed at the time, to learn to open up space both physically and mentally. Spaciousness in itself doesn't need that amount of flow. It can be very mellow. That's a good thing. I should make notes of the exercises involved in this particular yoga class. They are really good for me.",

        "msg": "Okay, so that was a very transient EQ. It lasted through the day, and then when it was time to sleep I got lots of energy and stayed up too long. When I lay down, I got amazing visuals and a huge amount of champagne bubbles. I had been doing a simple exercise for the lymph system before going to bed and taken som extra magnesium so I thought it was due to that, but I don't know. It grew and intensified. My whole body dissolved. It was wonderful. So A&P and dissolution. But then the fear came, with horrible nightmares. Oh the horror! The last fully realized person on earth had died. His longterm student started to teach people, me included, to keep the lineage alive. First it seemed to go rather well, but then I discovered that he was fake and that the real one had been killed too and then replaced by a former colleague of mine who had now picked up shapeshifting. In the real world she's a horrible teacher, cruel to the students and with a bad temper. In the dream she was manipulative, gaslighting, batshit crazy (in the dangerous way, not the charming one) and, as it turned out, a serial killer. She had killed the realized person and his student, and now she tried to kill me for finding out. Somehow I escaped but then got paranoid. I got support from the board of some sort and a partner came to pick me up, but we didn't have any proof so the killer was still free and she seemed to be able to find me anywhere. It was only thanks to my relationship with her as a colleque (she had her good sides that I really liked) that she hesitated about killing me, but it seemed very unreliable. In the dream I was in shock, had difficulties forming sentences and had memory lapses, and the fear was intense - both with regard to the killing spree and to the extinction of the dharma. I'm still spooked. So yay... darknighting.",

        "msg": "One example of the temptations mentioned above: Over the years I have developed some amazing coping skills for which I'm grateful. Unfortunately I have also developed coping skills that are very counterproductive, like kickstarting my discursive mind to overcome my difficulties with executive functioning. I'm really good at that, and in the long run it exhausts me and drains me. I think this is exactly what Ni Nurta has been talking about - the kind of \"relief\" that is unhealthy and that also maintains a dualistic view. I'm a dopamine addict. Giving in to impulses to use one of those strategies sort of feels good, but it also builds up frustration. So much dukkha! And when I listen inwardly, I notice that it actually doesn't feel good more than a fraction of the time. The kicks are so transient, and they lead to craving of more kicks, and there is no way to satisfy that craving, as it increases faster than the kicks has any chance to address, and the kicks and the cravings never meet anyway. The cravings only know themselves. They are hungry ghosts. Still, they seem to be convinced that \"just one more time\" would make all the difference, and they are so loud. I know that I need to let go of those strategies, but it's hard. Or that's what I keep telling myself. That's the discursive mind, though. I don't have to believe it. Letting go of them shouldn't have to be hard. It's not a doing. It's doing less . Awareness already knows. I know this. And it would save me so much time! Ehm, it will save me so much time. I can use that time for the stuff that is meaningful and valuable. I have better strategies now, like yoga exercises, bouncing on a trampoline, going for a walk, connecting to someone I love. --- During the yoga class, my life sort of flashed by, and I noticed how much I have made piece with my childhood in comparison to earlier in my adult life (well, at least at that point in time; it's probably transient too).

I noticed that what made it so unbearable was that I was glitching back and fort between dual and nondual, something that Lama Lena says bruises one's tsa (the energy channels). My tell for that is sensations of my right ear drum rapidly wobbling back and forth, with pressure changes sort of, and a sense of being stuck inside the head having to approach the world through that glitching barrier.

I can warmly recommend it for those who feel drawn to it. I think I feel a growing wish to take up the ng\u00f6ndro again, not as a ritual that needs to be held for the sake of duty, but as a support for raising Bodhicitta and maintaining a path that involves changing habits and overwriting reactional patterns with actions that arise from Bodhicitta.

It turns out that I needed a little vacation down the stack. I have spent several hours as vibrations today, and it took away so many levels of tensions. Form feels much less threatening and overwhelming now. I think I need to do this regularly, to heal. I think that is why the practice used to help me so much and why life has been so challenging again - one of the main reasons anyway. I don\u2019t think any (relatively) normally wired person could ever imagine the extent to which form is torture for people with wiring like mine. (No offense meant - some of my best friends are normal.) So now I'm adding \"being vibrations\" to the list of elements without which I can't survive as a mammal. Good to know! Oh, the relief! Okay, so being vibrations, yoga, a proper balance of neurotransmittors, water, natural elements, nourishment, light, enough sleep, L-Lysine... something like that. These are basics that need to be in place in order for anything to work. I still think that working up the stack is necessary, but I may need to do it more gently. While some people get messed up by too much emptiness too soon, I get messed up by too much form. I'm back to doing the ng\u00f6ndro again, but I allow myself breaks from it. Actually, Lama Lena said that it was the right thing to do with some of the side effects I got from it. I also learned that there are ways to shorten the practice, which makes it easier to fit into daily life. This weekend I'll do a \"working with emotions\" retreat with Lama Lena. I'm very much looking forward to that. The retreat has some experience requirements, based specifically on Dzogchen/Mahamudra, so I'm very greatful that they let me in. Oh, and I have also started to learn Nejang, Tibetan healing yoga (with some tsa lung mixed into it). It's awesome!

The working with emotions retreat with Lama Lena is the perfect triangulation to Michael Taft's RtS course. We are calling up five different categories of emotions, organized around the five Dhyani Buddhas, to strip them naked from stories, names and vedana labels, and experience them naked in their full glory as the five wisdoms. The categorization is just a tool, nothing real and solid. I don't get to phrase the phenomenology of the experiences while in the midst of the process, because that will distort the practice. It's a great practice. We are to practice this on the cushion, first short sessions with the easiest parts, then expand it, then apply it to our daily life, and finally seek up situations to develop it further (trigger practice). One step needs to be really easy before we move on to the next step.",

        "msg": "Night June 28-29: The Chenrezig practice last night got a bit psychedelic. I've been hesitant to report it because it sounds so extremely scripted in the midst of ongoing discussions. I got more concentrated than I usually do in a group, and there was clarity and confusion at the same time. The instructions of radiating out and eventually letting the light back in made no sense at all, because directions and sequentiality fell away. It was like the web of light, the flower of life, folded into itself and collapsed, not into a singularity but into vaste spaciousness that had no center. Nothing could radiate \"out\" to something else because there was no in and out, here or there. Sending out was sending in, or rather, the mere intention of light let there be light, and wherever the light was, was here and now. There was sort of a hyperclarity about this together with a sense of being effervescent and thoughts and images just popping up on their own without really being bound together to something coherent, and no need for coherence. Every little fragment was a perfect whole. There was movement, constant movement, but nothing substantial that was moving. I suspect this felt psychedelic because it's still not locked in, still new every time the veils fall away. Not the default. Not to this extent. And yet so very familiar. So \"of course\". There's a simpler version of everything being \"here\" that is more accessible. Or maybe it isn't simpler. I don't know. Maybe it's just closer to being default and therefore it does not feel psychedelic. It's also not an altered state like this session turned into, and a very energetic one at that. I still think that the ordinary one could probably deepen a bit without turning into some altered state, as there's still heaviness attached to it now and then. The heaviness is an altered state that makes false claims of being natural. Since that group practice experience, the effervescense has lingered. For a little while today there was some amount of fear letting itself be known. Subtle fear, subtle nausea. Thought fragments connotating zombiehood. Unborn, undead. Flashes from some horrible turkey movie with litteral turkey zombies. Flashes from that movie with Goldie Hawn in which she and a couple of others have gone immortal while their bodies keep falling apart (a comedy that scared the crap out of young Polly). And so I went out in the nature. It usually helps. Not that it makes the dissolving stop, but I have no issues at all with dissolving into and merging with the smell of pine forest lake at sunset or other associated sensory experiences that arise and fall away anew in every moment. I guess I'm not like Shinzen Young who can have the same experience with smelling garbage (I kind of hope that he still takes out the trash). It's pretty cool, huh, that the body can materialize effortlessly and instantly even when it feels so unsolid? And then instantly be effervescent again. It can even materialize selectively. Like that smile without a cat. Lots of timeless stillness by the lake, being the lake and the silence and the stillness and the fragrant air and the gracefulness of swimming water snakes.",

        "msg": "Something that supports the embracing of form is the Chenrezig practice that I do regularly, both in group (more formalized) and alone (more spontaneously). It's a combination of visualization, \"feelization\", mantra chanting and usage of other senses, and it has ritualized elements symbolizing both emptiness and form. It emphasizes the compassion side of the union between wisdom and compassion. One could also say that it's a practice on the Brahmaviharas, although the order of things and the categorizations differ. It could also be considered a magickal practice, although I guess tantric is a more common label. This evening there was a group practice. Just like in the last group practice session, but later in the session, both time and space fell away to some extent. The experience had timeless and centerless qualities. Sequentiality (as in perceived a such) was gone for a while. This time it wasn't psychedelic like before. No lava lamp lightshow, no stroboscopic lightshow, no kaleidoscopic lightshow. This was probably closer to what people refer to as a unity experience. There was no other. It was just being, in stillness. I think that for a while, separation was forgotten. When the group leader ended the meditation, separation arose again without difficulty. That just happened immediately. I remember touch sense becoming aware. At first, I couldn't quite localize it, but almost immeditaly there was a notion of there being hands, because we were to bring them together in front of us, so I had to localize them. This happened rather quickly and yet gradually. The notion of a field of hand sensations appeared before there were individual hands. I had my hands in my lap, one spooning the other one, and I couldn't feel the boundaries between them, or between them and the rest of the world, but they had an approximate location with some kind of vague center. Then boundaries appeared, but still with a sense of the meeting between them being aware on its own and in stillness rather than attention bouncing around and altering the polarization of subject-object duality. Now when I write about it, about one and a half hour later, I find that the duality appears when there's a sense of looking for it.",

        "msg": "I have also done lots of intense off-cushion practice today. I was working with a little neurodivergent kid (an amazingly cool kid!) who is nonverbal and explores the world in his own ways as well as communicates in his own ways. It's fascinating and requires a whole lot of presence. I get to discover so much of what I have come to take for granted, even though we also have some commonalities as to which common assumptions we haven't picked up. For a while today, when we were all alone in a huge sand box in a park, I felt so incredibly free. We were both totally immersed in sensory impressions from moving around in the sand and moving around sand with wholehearted focus. That little guy is a mindfullness genius! And our communication has to be so embodied that I can tangibly feel his intentions in my own body, which sort of makes his intentions my intentions. At other times, just as is also the case for me in my private life, he needs to step out of the intensity of a shared focus and of having to tune into another human being, which is also communicated at a meta level in such an embodied and immediate and yet subtle way that it's close to direct knowing. And then he goes on interacting with the world with such ease that it's like he becomes one with it at times. The dance between emptiness and form seems to come easy to him. I hope he will get to keep this. I didn't. I had to rediscover it and I'm still struggling with it.",

        "msg": "Many thanks! I think I get what you are saying about those processes reinforcing each other, Ni Nurta. I see it like this: when some pattern has been released, energies that were tied up in that entanglement are released too. At first that can feel awesome, like possibilities opening up, but soon those energies need to go somewhere, and they flood the infrastructure, using the pathways that are most accessible. Habitual pathways are usually most accessible, because trafficking them so often keep them open just like often used pathways in a forest. So when something is released, other challanges become stronger. And while I attend to those challenges, I neglect keeping the newly opened pathway trafficked and open and clear, so then it starts to get filled up with underbrush again, and of course, the more roots still remain, the faster the underbrush thickens and re-entangles. And the different kinds of roots seem to be in symbiosis with each other, helping each other to grow back. I often do what on a surface level sounds like the opposite practice to what you describe: I notice what does not seem to go on by itself and try to stop my sense of being the doer of it, with varying success. I suppose that deals with a different aspect. It doesn't freeze time, but empties out the sense of being a doer of what transpires in my mind. I have other practices that possibly resemble your practice somewhat more in its effects, such as deeply tuning into the silence and stillness that are inherent in everything. I have had one incident of time being completely frozen, in a very tangible way, but that was quite some time ago. It was like all the moments were laid out in space, already there. Nowadays it's more often a sense of time not being relevant... but that phrasing feels very reductive. It's more than that, but I can't verbalize it. Another version I have is sort of dwelling in the stillness that rides the waves of time passing in experience. It's a matter of synching up with the waves, if that makes any sense. I have had sort of frozen moments happening in rapid succession, but that has been door moments, nothing that I have had access to long enough to practice wih it. So your method sounds like it might be relatable, maybe, and also add new components to the practices I have. It sure sounds interesting enough. I'm not sure exactly what you are describing, though. Could you elaborate on it? Like, what kinds of occurances were you training to stop? Was it like thoughts running, or perceptions, or \"external\" objects in movement? And can you be more specific? Like, among external objects, making a fan or a fast-moving wheel look like it has stopped is fairly easy. Making a car look like it stops is not something that I can imagine working where I'm at, and making it objectively stop (or rather consensually stop) seems even more outlandish. I have been able to synch up my intentions with how a candle flame behaves (growing, diminishing, tilting to one side, tilting to another side, being still). I haven't done any of this with any systematic discipline, though. I might take it up when it feels like the time (hehe) is right for it. I think we have a commonality there, in not being driven by what is supposedly the next step that will take us somewhere in particular, but by what intuitively feels right and sort of in synch. There's a knowing with regard to what is needed. And the time might feel right for it soon; I can't tell. It seems possible, but I won't force it. So thankyou! I'm honored and grateful that you wanted to offer it to me. I wonder if your description of less moving at least partly refers to the same thing as my description of subject-object duality falling away... because in the duality mode, attention moves around really fast, causing all sorts of tension and pain and suffering. When sensations synch up to manifest as being aware in their own right, there is stillness. It's like everything is already evident. There's no need for attention to bounce around. Does that sound like what you are talking about, or are you referring to something different entirely? No need to mention no self? Heh, then why did you? You said \"at that point you won't perceive any actions your mind does as caused by any central agent/doer or self\". You managed perfectly well without talking about neurons, but you did talk about no self, and I'm glad you did, because it made it relatable. I always investigate methods like you describe, trying out different modifications, finding out what works for me, what affects and side affects result from different takes on it, and how different methods relate to each other. That's one of my greatest strengths as a practicioner. I'm extremely eclectic and experimental. Nothing could ever make me limit my practice to dogma. If you somehow have gotten that impression, then you're wrong. Not saying that you have, though. My logging doesn't cover everything I do. There's a lot of tacit knowledge. It's known on some other level than what can be readily verbalized, and for the time being, I prioritize tuning into it over trying to verbalize it. I love hacks, that organically developed tech that comes from really getting intimate with all the intricacies of mind, including personal mind quirks. I love them for their own sake. I think we are in agreement here, in not wanting to reduce the dharma to some simple parameters. I guess my approach to it in that \"this is it\" thread was to bring the complexity back into the brief statement, whereas you were bold enough to ditch it entirely. I'm fine with ditching it, really. And I'm totally okay with adding more nuance to the paths, and more differentiation too. I'm just opposed to reducing them to something that could be the refrain of an earworm. And actually, even if something really is it with regard to arahantship, that doesn't make much of a difference, because the path doesn't end there. And honestly, I don't think insight ends there either, except for some basic configurations that might be easier to separate from the rest. I think there are endless possibilities for insight when we don't parse it out like that. Like the siddhis, I don't think they are possible without some specific insights. I can't see why it shouldn't be possible to experience multiple realities, be at two places at once and so forth, but I imagine that it requires shredding away further layers of constructions that we tend to take for granted. It would require concentration, sure, but not just that. And I think that deeply pursuing morality work involves taking insight to new levels too. Models are models. They aren't the terrain. I use models for specific purposes without buying into them. They are all empty. I so appreciate it when you share your tech! That's some quality craftsmanship.",

It's a great approach. Yet I get frustrated, as it feels like people keep telling me what I aready know whereas there is something else that I have missed and keep missing, and so I get impatient. It migh be time for me to ramp up my concentration/focused surrendering again, to increase clarity and precision. In any case, there's still something to resolve there, because there's sort of a glitch between my approaches to concentration and awake awareness that becomes an artificial duality. The glitch feels emptier now than before, but it still holds me back. I have neglected my shamatha for so long now that it's quite challenging, which triggers more impatience. I need to remember to turn my impatience into an opportunity for investigation rather than buying into the frustration. I also need to remember to take baby steps rather than expecting to take up the shamatha where I left it off. Sometimes I can be such a spoiled brat in the practice. There was time for some more disentangling while letting my body sleep. I feel like I got to see something in it a bit clearer, but as I saw it in a nonverbal state, I can't access it with verbal thinking. Maybe it was related to Malcolm's pointers, maybe not.

        "msg": "In my practice log in the slack channel for the RtS course, I wrote this up somewhat differently. I think this kind of framing might be a helpful reminder to me, so I'll post that version here as well. Please bear with me. This log is a work document much more than it could ever be a display of some \"progress\". So here goes: --- I find it very helpful to combine the nondual practice with vipassana as taught in this course. The moments when I get drawn out of the view are such great pointers to what needs further investigation. In this thread at Dharma Overground, https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/message/22971370, Daniel Ingram posted a great tech desciption on how to use earworms as an object for the practice. As a reminder to myself, I'll post my reply here in my log: \u201dThis is great stuff. Thanks for the reminder and the tech description! I sometimes do this and find it useful, and then fall back to being annoyed again (gradually less often, though). I often use mantras to explore the subtle shifts between assuming being a doer and finding that it's just doing itself, but earworms are a goldmine in the sense that they are so available. I'll dig into it more systematically. I think what makes them annoying when that's the case is the delusion of being the doer, because that stance involves tensions that take efforts to maintain. We do a hell of a job to maintain the illusion, and the earworms threaten to undo all that job if we don't catch up with them constantly, and so we take on lots of extra effort. And of course, it gets extra annoying because the sensations of being a doer can't really catch up no matter how hard we try, and the more effort we put into catching up, the more \"threatening\" that gap becomes.\u201d I love tangible tech! I think this is one of those things that I need to see over and over again to strain those sankharas to the point of not falling back into assuming being the doer at all. I don\u2019t assume that this means that some sense of an I will stop arising. It seems like it\u2019s quite possible for the sensations of an I to arise without any ownership assumptions coming along with it, but that\u2019s the part that\u2019s still elusive and prone to falling back to habitual patterns. On the other hand, it also seems like the sense of an I doesn't have to arise in the moment, which is what we are practicing with, and I love it when it doesn\u2019t, as it makes experience so much less heavy. I believe this is something I need to soak in more and more often to really grok how available it is, and how natural. But I also need to integrate that there can be an organic and dynamic dance here, which has been pointed at in in the maps here at this course. This is something I need to see more for it to become seamless and effortless. Within a nonduality perspective this dance makes sense. Within a dualistic framework, it seems like a contradiction. A few months ago it was really bugging me how reality seemed to be shifting between incompatible frameworks. Then as I looked at the mechanisms of perception and started digging into the preprocessing, I could empirically see how a nonduality perspective can explain those shifts whereas a dualistic perspective just can\u2019t, because what it presupposes makes it impossible. I started reading the Nonduality book by David Loy, that Michael recommended, yesterday, and I was thrilled to see that it brings this up already in the introduction. I\u2019m so looking forward to digging into all the nuances that this book seems to offer, to get more tangible tech to work with in my practice. Yay!",

        "msg": "Working with earworms is an excellent practice. It really pinpoints exactly that glitch that remains for me, one of them anyway. I get it that I'm not supposed to entirely stop the subvocalizing but just see it for what it is when it occurs, without falling into the mistake of therefore assuming ownership of the doing. And sometimes the subvocalizing seems to happen without that hook in it. However, it is prone to fall into a duality between duality and nonduality rather than remain a dance within a nondual framework where duality just occurs seamlessly without morphing back into that simple duality with all the hooks in it. I think I need to practice on going back and forth between that state where no subvocalizing occurs, knowing that it's a state and not the real thing, and the sticky version of reality, too clearly see that difference and the dependent origination of those shifts. And I also need to go back and forth between the nondual nonduality and the nondual non-sticky duality - when it's accessible - to see the difference there, which is much subtler but crucial to really getting the \"one taste\". And I need to go back and forth between the sticky duality and the non-sticky (non-dual) duality to make it fall into place. I'm not sure if there's an optimal sequential order for how to go about this. I suspect that the most important thing for me is to be aware of which is which, to avoid misunderstandings.",

        "msg": "I have had an intense practice day today. I'll make notes on it if I can, but I'll start with just jotting down some observations on my mind state right now - once again if I can. Okay. It's... wow, how to put this into words? A new version of centerless maybe? Or just weird? Hard to tell. Reality moves around me rather than me in it, pretty much like is illustrated in the headless way videos with Richard Lang that Stickman3 recommended. That's not new in itself. It was pretty much like that before I developed enough visual thinking and proprioception to really navigate as a body in a world. I have also had experiences of it coming back after that development. It has been coming and going. But I guess what is new to my adult life is that it really feels groundless. This used to terrify me when I was a kid. I'm not afraid now. If there is fear, it's extremely subtle. Hm, yes, there's some very subtle fear bubbling up to the surface momentarily. But there's a lot of peace. And lightness. Extreme lightness. Like I might float up to the skye anytime. And there's fluidity. And it's definitely dreamlike. Ultra-dreamlike. But also real in a matter-of-fact way, and newborn. And the delay between something being aware and being registered as an experience is smooth, like a sound effect - chorus, reverb or whatever the good one is called (I mix them up). Like reality is singing in the bathtub. And it's huge. I'm huge. Boundless. Except for some moments when I sort of try to fit all of it into my head, which distorts it and makes my head feel huge and lightheaded, like a huge balloon, but then the boundaries fall away, because my head really has nothing to do with it. My head is inside me. Ha, this must be that \"I AM\" stage that people talk about. Yeah, I can see how one can get stuck in trying to stabilize it. It's totally cool. But it also seems like it might be a good idea to get grounded. I'll describe my practice later.",

I had to stay present, couldn't seek distractions, and at the same time I got a lot of space to really dig into those earworms inbetween more intense interactions. He has his own spaciousness, and we can share the experience of each being in our own spaciousness, next to each other or while cuddling. I find it very healing. Earworms: I got access to lots of non-stickiness, both the nondual nonduality and the nondual duality. It's cool how when the doer assumption falls away, the complexity of the sound grows in complexity and richness. It's quite the relief to be able to just enjoy it wihout having to subvocalize all the sounds. And when subvocalizing occurred, it didn't feel like an obsession, but as something that just occurred. Assumptions of being the doer happened, but it didn't stick. It was good to have the earworm practice as a default practice to fall back on over and over. So accessible, so. easy to fit into daily life. And the momentum from it bled through to other occurances as well. It became natural to notice shifts between nondual nonduality, nodual duality, and sticky duality. It reduced the amount of stickiness. After work there was a 90 minutes session of the working with emotions group that I'm part of. Lots of sharing, lots of pointers.",

        "msg": "More on the earworms: There actually seems to be cases when earworms appear without subvocalizing and without any sense of being the doer but still are connected to suffering. Maybe that could be described as nondual hearing of samsaric reactional patterns within a dualistic framework. I'm thinking about a specific kind of hallucination that I have experienced in stressful time periods on several occasions, one that I apparently share with many other autistic people (I was once pointed towards a whole long thread about it on a forum): hearing one's mobile phone signal loud and clear even if the phone is dead in one's hand. This can be described perfectly well within a scientific materialistic framework, and that's the explanation I use in most contexts, but if I consider it within this new framework, it points to other sankharas that are probably entangled with the sense of separation and ownership of agency but not the same as assuming being the doer of the earworm. I guess the case is the other side of the coin: in a dualistic paradigm, occurrances are assumed to be either internal or external, so when there is no sense of ownership of doing, we perceive it as external, and when that doesn't fit with the consensual categorization of internal vs external, it's considered an anomaly. Assuming non-doership as a contrast to something else is inherently dualistic. And yet, in the hallucination, the separation between internal and external has collapsed. It just isn't seen for what it is. Neither buying into the hallucination nor discarding the perception as faulty because of an assumed separation between inside and outside is seeing it as it is. And of course, when the \"external\" earworm is a reification of samsaric reactional patterns, that's a whole mess of patterns to untangle. Hm, this also implies that mantras can be taken to the level of actually being heard \"here, there and everywhere\". I haven't yet persued it to that level. That's something to explore! It would probably shake up taken-for-granted concepts some more.",

The storytelling around that involves cycling, neglected yoga regime, jet lag from the RtS course, heatwave, neglected morning light routine, hormones, energy flowing into habitual patterns, etc. Blablabla. Anyway, yesterday (July 16th, 2021) I tried out some of the movements in Carlos Castaneda's Magical Passes (the first of the six groups) and Tensegrity (vol. 1). It's not like I was able to do any of it that well yet, as it was the first time I tried it, but it did something. The hearing effects from the nondual absorption came back, some of them anyway, and late in the evening I was able to do Michael's latest guided meditation for an hour while reclining without any dullness whatsoever. So maybe I'll make the effort of learning all those moves. If they really shake up the taken-for-grantedness of human perception, that's awesome, and if they don't, at least they are good for my focus and seem to work with some stagnated energy in my body. They didn't make me wired up either. I was able to sleep well after the meditation. I was woken up by the screams from a little baby hare in the darkest hour, and I had to save it from my cat, prepped with rubber gloves and the Medicine Buddha mantra. Thankfully it seemed to be allright. And then I was able to sleep well again, until it was morning and I got up fairly early to enjoy the morning light before the sun got too hot. I did some chanting and some ng\u00f6ndro and took care of the altar that I have neglected a lot lately. It seems that I may have let go of some bad habits of killing time. It's too soon to tell, though. I'm not sure I can trust it. Not trusting it is probably the issue that I need to address. With strong enough intention, no doubt is needed. Of course I can trust it. Do I want to? I sure hope so. Parts of me want to eat the cookie and have it too. Be free from habitual patterns while still being able to enjoy them as usual. I don't think it works like that.

It was very difficult at first, but somehow it stopped being difficult. And I have actually always had plenty of love since then. So maybe it does work the way you said, I don't know. I suspect that it won't if you hold on to that thought, though.",

There were times when the stressresponses in the mammalian body were obvious, such as a surge of adrenaline, but it didn't affect my behavior, not even my tone of voice (which has throughout my life had the tendensy of being overly expressive, much more affected than my feeling tone). The emotional charge wasn't there either. I was aware of the stressresponses in the body, including subtler ones, and watched them peter out while remaining calm. I would have preferred less intensity and less agitation around me, but it wasn't hard to deal with it. And this despite my mistake with the medication this morning. When it was at its worst, the vipashyana practice sort of knew that it was needed, and it set itself to empty upon arising mode. As the intensity varied a lot, there were also lots of ocassions where I would have felt awfully bored earlier in my life. Now I have the practice. So much to play with! Observing sensory experience, playing with it, watching shifts between different modes, listening to mantras being chanted in my mind, and so forth. Lots of dissolving of the boundaries of the body, lots of nada sound, lots of energetic stuff. I grounded myself now and then, so it was smooth. After work I went to a lake to be with all the elements at once. It was divine. I went swimming with my clothes on and let them dry in the sun and in the wind. While waiting for my train I revisited my early practice of watching how the mind constructs sight (I had made it a habit to always do it while waiting for trains). I noticed some funny bugs in the photoshopping of the platform - patterns disappearing in the periphery and stuff like that. As I'm writing, the body seems to want to dissolve. I think I'll lie down and let it. I'm feeling rather blissful, in a relaxed way.",

The time leading up to stream entry, in third vipassana jhana I was drawn into experiences of having my senses turned inside out, one at a time. When it came to hearing, I experienced that the hearing was drawn out through my right ear out into space and circled around to enter back through my left ear. That's exactly the development that I have been going through in a much slower way ever since then. Very recently it entered back through my left ear, and when that happened, I noticed a \"surround system\" sound effect that constructs space (more about that in my latest posts in my thread about the phenomenology of nondual perception; please bear with my earlier very weird responses - the process took a different turn that made me shift my focus very suddenly so at the time I wasn't able to take in all the great advice I received).

I tried out some new agey guided meditation aiming at remembering experiences from the womb, for the fun of it For some reason it was very unpleasant. I noticed fear reactions, like bodily panic. It felt like it was difficult to breathe. My mum did have a complicated delivery giving birth to me two weeks late. She did something wrong with the breathing, she has told me, and ended up causing a young doctor to faint, or maybe almost faint, at the sight of her black and blue genitalia after the protracted delivery. The labor had been medically initiated. It seemed like I never wanted to be born in the first place, lol. I don't know if it's possible to recover such embodied memories that easily. I hadn't expected to feel anything, but the feelings were palpable. There was a breathing exercise with a side-to-side movement of the head for the purpose of letting go. I don't know what to think of any of that, but it felt good doing it. I did the first two groups of movement in the first series of magical passes. Not as elegantly as in the video ai linked to, and not as energetically. It still felt good. Lots of dissolving. Smooth, light dissolving. A couple of hours of reclining meditation that started with a wide awareness of what was going on in all sense gates, first as form and then gradually emptier end emptier. The main part of the session played out at a vibratory level. Eventually the senses weren't clearly separated. At the end of the meditation, the experience resembled lucid dreamless sleep. Maybe it was, I don't know if it's even relevant to try to categorize it. When I got up, there was great clarity. Everything was vibrating and shaking. The contours of my body feel fuzzy. There's some level of nondual perception, especially kinesthetically. It seems like the sense of separation has been selectively dissolved.",

        "msg": "Thankyou so much for sharing! This all makes sense. I guess I'm a bit obsessed with why this manifests, which makes me impatiently dismiss the hows. Seeing your rich description, that becomes clear to me. And yet I have worked as an ethnographer for 19 years! I should know that \"how\" is a much more productive question than \"why\". I do see all that. I just didn't think it was important. But seeing you tease it out brings new light to it. How fascinating that something so rich and complex not only can manifest but also be taken for granted! Embarrassingly enough, I have basically been trying to get rid of space. Crazy, huh? So... are we stuck with it? I do play with depth. Or rather, it plays with me. I play with the doppler effect too. I started my practice within Shinzen Young's system, and \"gone\" and expansions and contractions are a big deal in it, so that's something I have been drilled to notice. Yet it always felt a bit \"duh\". Gosh, why am I so dismissive of the world? I kind of want it to surprise me. Like, if the doppler effect suddenly wasn't there. I guess I really expected for my awareness to just tag along for the ride even if the car goes all the way to Norway or something. If everything is here, then why can't it? When my practice was all about vipassana, the space inbetween mind moments stood out so clearly. The practices I'm doing now are more about stillness, and it seems that it changes what stands out. Phenomena occur more smoothly, wavy, dance-like. And I like that. It's beautiful, peaceful, full of grace. But I also miss the staccato. I want to have it all, lol. Why can't I just shift back and forth between those modes? Do I have to choose? Can you shift back and forth? I know that I'm craving, grasping, clinging and I can see the dukkha in it. But there's got to be a fundamental difference between awakening and some darn acceptance crash course, right?",

Maybe tuning into the high speed of reality with attention rather than a broader awareness devours sugar. Maybe that's why dry vipassana makes you cranky. Maybe vipassana jhanas are the body's desperate way of consuming energy by using a reserve of chemicals that allow the brain to sustain longer when the sugar intake isn't enough. Maybe inner fire correlates with extremely rapid burning of calories to sustain the brain and the nervous system on high speed. Okay, back up on the rollercoaster! This was fun! Don't worry!

That wobbling muffled whisper in my right ear, before the left ear came online too, was extremely annoying at times.

        "msg": "It seems that for me, intense fast vipassana on sensory experience fuels other developments, so I'll keep doing it. The same goes for physical movements that require a lot of concentration for me to coordinate. Having tangible tech to apply also boosts my motivation in a way that sitting to just end all reactivity pronto does not. The latter is more a natural result of the former, so the combination is great. I do have tech for the nondual practice - really helpful tech - but all of it requires great mindfulness. For me, vipassana boosts the mindfulness. But the nondual practice is what makes daily life less challenging as it really does take away reactivity in a way that people around me have pointed out. Vipassana a la MCTB2 makes me concentrated faster than anything else, maybe because it keeps the ADHD wiring busy. It also doesn't require of me that I feel like a Buddha when I start the session. Furthermore, I know that terrain intimately, which makes it easier to call up aspects to work with, and I think I'm in the process of learning something important about how intent works.",

        "msg": "I think I had a fruition from crossing the threshold out to my patio today. Lots of energetical disentangling in letting go meditations. Now that the components of my hearing have become clearer, the kazoo player analogy feels even more spot on. I don't remember having focused on the kazoo player with regard to \"outer\" sound, though. However, I do remember there being a shift earlier in my practise (I think it was as I got second path, or maybe it was already around stream entry): suddenly it became so clear where in space the sounds were. The sound simply takes place at its source (except in absorption during which it's nowhere and everywhere if heard at all). Before that, I had from time to time had great difficulties in determining the sources of sounds, so I guess I must have heard the sounds as taking place in my ears and brain, which probably means that I was focusing on the kazoo player. Yet, I have been able to hear several tunes at once, both mentally and consensually externally, which came in handy when I was singing in choirs. I doubt that the kazoo player was doing that. So the hearing probably shifted inbetween nondual hearing and kazoo player depending on the situation. I just didn't notice it. Hm, maybe it was during nondual hearing that synesthesia kicked in. Maybe synesthesia is always a form of nondual perception? Do people normally hear sounds as occurring in their ears? That seems awfully limited. Earworms still have a tendency to trigger the kazoo player, but it has become more flexible. I can turn focus away from the kazoo player and let him rest. I appreciate that, because it takes away a barrier to remembering and imagining people's voices and makes experience richer, and there is less tension.",

One being smelling where the organ is, which seems to be somewhat spread out, and tissues in the cavity above the palate seem to play an important part. The other mode is very clearly that smells take place \"out in the world\", and that mode is much richer. It often comes online when I'm out in the nature and it makes it feel like it's all aware. I have played with training myself to track mushrooms with my sense of smell, with good results (there are some fun stories there, for another time perhaps) but it needs to be maintained or it gets lost. If that mode is switched on among people, it can be overwhelming as it tells me too much. At least I used to find it overwhelming. When I was pregnant, I couldn't switch it off. I would have constant access to information about where complete strangers had turned in a different direction, as their paths left traces. I could almost see the lines. I don't have control over which mode is on. That's something to play with, to investigate what components take over in the dualistic mode. Thanks!",

The last couple of days I have had fairly severe physical (inflammatory) pain due to food intolerances, especially in my back. If I relax the body and refrain from moving it, it falls away, which means that I don't feel the pain. I find that for instance when I wake up in the morning, I tend to lie there in that semi-formless state too long and that it is demoralizing. Now I could go all Ni Nurta and learn to let the body fall away while being in movement, but I think the level of pain as of today is actually not so bad. I'll use it for equanimity practice, and instead of letting the body fall away, I'll be very present to it by doing yoga. That helps with the healing instead of just bypassing the pain. I'll also work on staying within that sweetspot where awareness gets spacious without escaping stuff.",

        "msg": "November 17th, 2021 Just to catch up on my notes on the fly (the wordings aren't exact in any way): Current intention: Cut the crap, put things into proportion and let every moment be newborn Lately there has been struggling with the samsaric realm. When awake awareness comes through, it feels amazing. That light smoothness and seamlessness isn't always subjectively experienced, though. The compartmentalization comes back online, that dualistic split that makes awake awareness seem like a separate thing (which it isn't). The struggle is engaging with (or trying to avoid) some underlying health issuesa d subjectively overwhelming demands from the outside world, which leads to both stress and fatigue. On the other hand, spontaneous dream practice in awake awareness occurs. It's not very regular, but it does happen. I have let go of the idea of lucid dreaming, because it doesn't seem important to distinguish between dreaming/sleeping and not dreaming/sleeping when it happens. I very rarely think \"Oh, I'm dreaming\", but rather just realize that everything that I can sense is mind-created and get fascinated in the mechanisms of that. The latest example occurred on the night to November 12th (my birthday). It didn't involve moving around in 3D space, but watching flat but beautifully intricate and colorful pictures that would show up like on a screen. I have forgotten which screen that is in Kasina terminology, but it wasn't grainy at all. A lot of it had sort of a tarot card print look. I don't read tarot cards, so I don't know if there was any symbolism there, and that wasn't the focus at all. Just amazement that the mind can create such images and present them as if I'm really looking at a solid print. I was able to take longer looks than earlier in my practice. There was text there that I could read, although I don't remember the content; I wasn't interested in the content, just in the fact that I could read it without the text morphing into something else. It was all emptiness and form at the same time. I intuitively knew how long I could look at a specific detail without it breaking apart, and I was stretching that boundary without grasping. New images showed up at a regular pace, and I effortlessly let go of the ones that fell away. I forgot them. The only content I remember is that there was a red flower in one of them and some kind of animal (rabbit? deer?) in one and that there were lots of details that I could zoom in and out on and study the texture of. There was a great RtS stack this night/morning, and the previous one was great too. It is very helpful. This class I was rejoicing in seeing that one of my class mates has had a huge breakthrough. It was visible! That's an understatement. He looked so incredibly open and light. There was no question that a major barrier had fallen away. It immediately reminded me of how simple awake awareness is. Just one glance of that open face. Very cool. Getting back on track with mixing practice, that is, getting back into awake awareness over and over again while taking on the daily challenges with help from meditation breaks and yoga breaks. Also starting an autoimmune paleo diet today (with some further restrictions due to other intolerances) as my body has clearly signalled that the so called safe food that I didn't want to give up on is no longer safe anyway. I tentatively tried it out yesterday evening, and my body (physical body and energy body alike) said \"Hell yeah!\". Just making a note of it, because I suspect that the degree to which I comply to it will affect my practice. Sometimes there is a jerkiness to the noticing of the unfolding moment, like a glitch between non-doing and doing. That's interesting to just let be aware. I heard a great analogy in an an (overly) cheerful audiobook by Peter Singer (Unthethered Soul) that fits well here: trying to make it go away by using effort is like trying to take measures to stop the rings spreading on the water as a leaf falls to the surface of a completely still lake. The jerkiness is like those rings on the water. I'd say that the moment is fleeting seemlessly rather than being still, but the stance of noticing has a quality of stillness to it.",

        "msg": "It seems that I have had a deficiency in one or more key B vitamines for quite some time. Just making a note here that when the juice seems to be missing in the practice without an apparent reason, especially together with lack of drive and the feeling that antidepressants (or just neurotransmitters in general) don't quite seem to reach their target destination, it might be helpful to take supplements of B6, B12 and folate in combination, maybe even methylized versions. Not in any excess, of course, and if one's body is ine tune with the medical model for what values are normal, it might be a good idea to check one's levels first (mine is not). Vitamine B complex is good for trouble with the energy channels too, according to Lama Lena. In starting with the supplements (again; they were a life saver several years ago as well), I notice that some time after taking them, energy is flowing freely and it is easier to concentrate. It is very noticable. I got into something with formless qualities today, to the extent that the body intermittently fell away. That hasn't been the case for quite some time now. It wasn't the pure versions of the formless jhanas, though, but something mixed. Emotional tones were still there, so probably third vipassana jhana with formless qualities or something like that. When the body wasn't gone, it was there very intensely just like in third vipassana jhana, with the sense of being forcefully torn (by the attentional system). Whatever I turned my focus to became so intense that it was almost violent. Body parts focused upon felt pressurized and torn at the same time. When I didn't focus on them, they were gone. When I focused on emptiness, or some construct of it, that got so intense that it actually freaked me out a bit. That hasn't happened for a long time. I found that when needed I could tune into the idea of some body sensations to bring that part of the body back, to ground myself. I laid like this for hours, and I intermittently fell asleep. Just before laying down to meditate, I was having withdrawal symptoms from my antidepressants because I took them a couple of hours or so late. I used to be that sensitive but haven't been for a long time. I think the vitamine B supplements made the medz more efficient all of a sudden, so that they make more of a difference, which is a good thing, but it means that I need to observe more regularity. When I took the medicines, late, I made the mistake of adding some extra 5-htp to increase serotonine faster (the withdrawal symptoms were hellish), and it turned out that I responded to them as strongly as I used to do before, which hasn't been the case for a long time either, so there was quite the mess of neurotransmitters going on. Going into vibrational mode and further into something more formless made it bearable, so I continued with it even while dreaming. The dreaming had some horror elements to it, together with the meditative experiences described above. In the dream I had chrystals in my hands that I could focus on to get back into my body when things got too scary. Amethysts, at least one of them, and maybe also a rose quartz (heh, I'm wearing one of each on necklaces, come to think of it). While it might sound nightmarish, it was such a grace compared to the state I was in while neurotransmitters were all jumbled up, and all in all, I appreciated the experience. I could switch between something that bordered to nothingness and something with energetic qualities. In the energetic mode, the nada sound was roaring. Lights and colors were available when called up. It made different shapes. There were also spirals and a sense of being drawn through a tunnel. Not with any apparent architecture, though. Not as clear as that. More like wormholes in Stargate SG-1, or a bleak version of it. The almost-nothingness mode retained some vibrational quality to it in the visual field. (I may have stayed on the threshold because of previous experiences with the formless jhanas repeating themselves for hours in a way that spooked me out during threshold moments because of the forcefulness and involuntariness of it.) I could sort of call up qualities from different kinds of practices. Bodhicitta was very helpful to call up, because it took away the fear. I didn't use the concepts in calling up. The words weren't there. Putting labels to the qualities is only done in retrospect and it probably distorts things.",

So that's why I could so often do that before: my life sucked and I was nauseaus all the time. I had kind of forgotten that. The 3 C:s stood out perfectly clear. There was no doubt whatsoever. Energetically I was taken for a ride that felt like... well, going into warp speed with a vessel that isn't quite fit for the journey due to compromised integrity of the hull. Inbetween the strong vibrations of the vessel, there was effortless floating with a strong sense of joy from that effortlessness as it took away the suffering of trying to maintain the integrity of the hull. That joy was inherently unstable and sort of coupled with the suffering itself. Like, the suffering and the joy were really the same energy, just manifesting differently, with different degrees of materiality. The shaky parts of the ride were inherently unstable too, as the materiality that made the shakiness possible fell apart as soon as it arose, and the falling away released energy anew. What a weird thing, first jhana, when broken apart into its elements. Layers of tensions in the body were released, especially hips, feet, ankles and shoulders. And of course the face and layers behind it, but I don't think that was new - just trimming away the weed that had started growing again.",

The reason I noticed this was bathtub meditation with ears under water. I did a combination of open awareness, shamatha with a candle flame, and tantra.",

With this amount of pain I have previously gone to the ER or fainted (I only recently found out that it's endometriosis), but this time I decided to just be fully aware of the pain and explore it. There really is much more space than pain in it. Also, I dropped out of the idea that it was happening to me. Instead it was just a series of phenomena that arose and vanished (at the same time). It turned into a pretty nice meditative experience. I didn't reach out for pain killers because it seemed like the instrumentality of such an act would make the pain solid, and when I fully relaxed, it wasn't.",

        "msg": "Cutting through brain fog is much more difficult, because the fog makes me forget that I'm trying to cut through it. Two sips of orange juice and I'm in oblivion for hours. I don't know if I finally managed to cut through it thanks to steadying my intent or if the intent just steadied because it was time for the fog to end anyway. It felt like a rather sudden shift, so maybe a little bit of both. How weird it is to have confused dreams layered upon the consensual reality and being unable to tell the difference. The only description of that state that I have come across that explains it in a way that actually makes sense is from Castaneda's books: a state where the assemblage point has been moved from its usual position and yet not fixed in a new position. The assemblage point is the key to solidifying perception in order to make it appear in a clear way. At the same time it sets the limits for what is possible to perceive. If we manage to fix it in a different position, we'll perceive an alternative reality, but if it moves from its position without finding a new one, we remain in a confused and foggy state. So I guess I just managed to shift it back into its habitual position. I wonder if I could have fixed it into a new position and what would have happened then. I guess I could explore that, but I'm not sure its worth it. Maybe with a trusted trip-sitter, lol. I would probably be the first person in the history to need a trip-sitter for drinking orange juice.",

        "msg": "Thankyou! I appreciate it. I do the morning thing - not as regularly nowadays as I used to for a period when I was more in tune. I did it this morning, though (before the juice), and felt that it cleared things out. I want to do more of that. I'll try the hung phet thing. I've tried phet before but never a full mala, just a few shouts, because that's what I have been taught, and I haven't found that very helpful. I thought that maybe I failed at looking directly at the mind while shouting, a failing which will reportedly only scare your flees (or, as I have found out empirically, your cats). I guess that if I do a full mala, it might increase the chanses of right focus for at least one of the shouts. And if I manage to do it, I'll at least cut through the freeze response. I think I'll try your personal practice first, though, if I'm able to in that state (first I need to see through all the layers of dreams of getting out of bed that do not result in any actual movement). I like its compassionate touch. Yes, it really feels like energetic blockages and at the same time as being seduced by ignorance and sucked into oblivion. Do you know how to work with the nadis outside the body? Wait a minute, I think that's what I'm doing when immersed in the healing version, which I don't personally regard as brain fog because it doesn't feel foggy when that occurs. In that state, it's like there are energy threads all around me and they are disentangling. So yeah, I do work with that, I guess. I just don't usually regard it as the same thing because of the lack of fogginess. The energy threads are vague, so I guess it still isn't clear, but in that version none of it feels heavy or sticky, and when I come out of it, I feel refreshed and clear. If it is an absorption, it's not one of the regular jhanas. It might be a nondual absorption at the Sambhogakaya level, I don't know. It usually happens either when I have been overwhelmed and surrender to that (there's so much energy to release from overwhelm - pretty cool!) or when I rest in the afternoon because the process communicates to me that I need to (there's a pull together with loud nada sound and a sense of being unsolid) and then all apparent solidity just falls apart.",

I haven't tried any of it systematically yet, but the thought of all those beings in the hungry ghost realm helped me today in dealing with daily life. In my version, spontaneously, the hungry ghosts were all dependent on my energy, and while I was too indifferent to doing something about my brain fog for my own sake, I cared enough about all those beings to snap out of it and get something done. I agree with you with regard to compassion. I don't think the common usage of the word in English does it justice, but it's convenient to call it something, so that's what I call it. Invoking it is key to my practice. Honestly, I wouldn't be able to get out of my bed without it. Yes, I know which teacher you follow, but it's always interesting to get a person's own accounts of how the practice manifests. So thanks for that! I'm not very visually oriented, but I do sense energetic phenomena now and then, and I have visual memories of that but I'm not sure that it has involved vision while it happened. It seems to be more kinesthetic for me, or maybe synesthetic, or beyond the division into separate sense gates. I really don't know. That's why I'm so curious. I have done some work within different paradigms, with different maps of the chakras, so I'm not sure how to visualize, as I would then have to choose. Being empirically driven comes more naturally to me. I did feel/see/sense energy streaming out from my crown and showering down in an egg-like shape once, after stream entry. It all seemed unusually untangled and clean at that moment. I think the nadis are pretty frizzy, unruly and messed up most of the time, which is why there is so much disentangling going on. There was a period when \"tentacles\" reached out far from my body to do the disentangling. I could sense it very clearly while doing restorative yoga. They were so long and so many and so busy with the disentangling. It felt good when they did that, but sometimes it felt like they went too far away from my physical body, and I had to call them back. My yoga teacher at the time saw how those tentacles reached out far outside my physical body, doing repair work and rebuilding infrastructure. She described this to me before I had told her about my experience of it. I don't sense it as clearly now; the clarity seems to vary over time, just like I can sometimes do some healing with my hands whereas most of the time I have no idea how I ever did that (or rather how it did that through me). Do you mean \"combing\"? I recently did that spontaneously without knowing that it's an existing practice. Or maybe more stroking. It felt like it wanted to happen.",

Pemako aren't the only ones with maps, after all, and it seems like all maps can get us into trouble, in more than one sense, so I guess we all need to assess for ourselves which maps are worth the risks and how to use them. I have actually had visions (maybe I already said that), but I can't take any credit for them. They have been instances of grace bestowed upon me. I can't count on them to appear at will or at any predictable pace. About what to visalize, I probably misunderstood you. I thought that when you suggested using visualization to work with the nadis, you meant that I should visualize the energy channels and the whole infrastructure of them. I don't believe that the fear causing you to pull back somtimes was the same as my experience of having the energy go too far from my body. It sounds to me like different kinds of oopses. I couldn't call them back out of fear. On the contrary, I had to sort of persuade them to come back by using trust. When the energies went too far, I looked really sick and... well, aged. And when they came back, I looked healthy again. It was weird. There are stories around that, as to where the energy went and why, but something tells me that it's not a good idea to get entangled in such stories again. The truth is that I don't know what it was. But it's also true that Daniel helped me out and that I performed a ritual that ended with lights in the sky. Thankyou so much for sharing the details of your energy work! So few do. I used to have painful tensions in different chakras, giving me very clear hints as to what to work with, but now it's much more subtle. I have a hard time recalling how it was before. When did that pain stop? I really don't know. I know that a big chunk of it went away suddenly at stream entry, but the rest of it? Hm. I like you too.",

        "msg": "This part of the path is challenging for me. I find that I need to go back to basics a lot and that I have been sloppy. Maybe it's just what naturally unfolded as I explored new pathways. I couldn't do everything at once. Regardless, I think now is the time to integrate it, and that requires that I rebuild what I have neglected. Maybe it's also the case that I'm back at the lower \u00f1anas, starting a new fractal of the multidimensional cycling towards third path. I don't know. In some senses it feels like starting over from the beginning. In other senses, it feels like further nuances are opening up around those basics. I can't quite put words to it, though, so maybe it's just wishful thinking. I do know that I need to ramp up whatever skill sets one prefers to slice and dice it into. Sensory clarity, concentration power and equanimity, according to Shinzen's old recordings. There are things that the narrow mind blurs out because it doesn't want to see it - that's very obvious - and so far it's outsmarting me. Some observations: A lot of suffering around physical pain is gone, that is, \"normal\" amounts of pain, nothing exceptional. I suddenly understand pointers that used to sound like something a sphinx would say. Like Malcolm's suggestion to tap into the joy (or bliss?) in front of me. Hey, cool! It's literally there! It has a smooth, silky texture and it just hovers there! It also makes for a smoother entrance into first jhana - less jarring, less turbulent. So I have been playing with that a bit. Previous motivational drives don't work, which is frustrating. Sometimes I spontaneously just do stuff, and then it's surprisingly fun, but often that isn't accessible. I think I may have burned out a bit because when insights made some things easier, I started demanding too much from myself relative to what I have energy for. And all the doing involved in that was counterproductive to seeing through the doer. It contracted things. There is something appealing to the notion of starting over again. Starting on the path was such a powerful thing. If I had to start all over again, from the beginning, I would definitely do it again. So what's the problem, really? There isn't one. When I put it like that, it's very simple. And that's liberation, right there, in that simplicity. The practice is just what unfolds. There is no doubt there. And that's mindblowing in its simplicity.",

For instance, now when I look at a lamp-shade in pleated cloth, the image vibrates in fractals of rapid pulses (not enough clarity to map it exactly), but there is also a slow wave to it. If I tune into the slow wave of it rather than the rapid vibrations, at regular rate the fabric of the lamp-shade appears to have an even surface. Yet, the vibrations are still there, flashing by images of the structure just like before. It's like attention zooms in and out at a regular pace while all the different levels are still somehow aware. But there's fractals to that too, because attention still does the flickering thing. So maybe it's not attention that does the zooming in and out, but consciousness? Uh, I don't know. But it's complex, that's for sure. And in the breath, what I used to think of as spirals in the sensations seems to be the fractal nature of vibrations.",

There's a tangible energetic shift (spaciousness, easier to breath, smoothness, nada sound and an inherent stillness together with a flowiness). - large quantities of gentle yoga and some basic QiGong massage (I'm putting together some sessions for the group of autistic adults that I work with, which means that I get to do it in some of my work hours). This helps with counteracting my tendency for winter depression, so it's great for my practice. - shamatha, mainly on the breath but also some Brahmaviharas and some playing with the joy/bliss in front of me. I haven't really had the time to get deep into it yet, but for the moment my aversion to it is gone and that means that jhanic factors are available. - RtS stuff.

I'm also in one of those phases where I clearly see not only the kind of attachment described above but also a huge variety of less flattering chains of reactions unfolding, a lot of it having to do with the path itself. Self-absorbed shit related to it. I remember experiencing this as extremely yucky before. I'm not as disgusted now, and not because there is less to be disgusted about, because there is plenty enough. I think it's finally starting to sink in that seeing it isn't just good because it needs to be seen, but also because seeing it is liberating in itself. Having to see it isn't a punishment or something. It really does start a different chain. Wow. On its own. Isn't that amazing? in honor of this insight, I have started rewatching Dirk Gently's holistic detective agency on netflix. I find that it has some hillarious pointers in it, which is probably purely coincidental, hehe.",

I can't even tell if it's from my subconscious or something else. It seems pretty arbitrary. In the RtS class meditation, sensory processing seemed to take place as much outside of my body as in it, and my body was just one of many things being perceived or aware. There was also a sense of everything having sort of a soap bubble quality, and anytime it would just sort of pop, revealing the absolute silence inside the bubbles. Then there was a sense of a point located at the third eye that seemed solid. Investigating it further, there was no solid point to be found, but there was a sense of being drawn in, and lights were released. The point kept \"trying\" to solidify itself. In dealing with this, the sense of nonlocality was gone. Lots of nada sound in daily life.",

Apparently, the dream logic wasn't threatened when one of my partners, who have decided not to have any more children, had a baby with his ex. It wasn't threatened by my vegan partner wanting meat. It wasn't threatened when he and I visited my dead grandmother or when the small place where I grew up had beautiful mountains added to it. It was fine with my grandmother having two extra sets of old stoves for no apparent reason, but when I touched them and they were filthy , I knew instantly that it was a dream. Haha! And even though I knew that it was a dream, I still felt the need to go wash my hands (in an extra basin that was out of place). I knew that the basin and the water and the entire scenery were all just dream imagery, but it was yucky, so I washed my hands anyway. Since it was just a dream, I didn't care about water getting all over the floor, which I commented on out loud. I commented on it to that accompanying partner, whom I somehow still related to as real. __ While I'm at it, I might as well mention some spontaneous dream yoga that occurred a couple of days ago or so, with awareness in the sleep of how the mind was fabricating imagery and rejoycing in how the images were empty and yet had so clear form.",

        "msg": "Due to life challenges, I lost momentum with my shamatha practice and lost the daily routine. I feel a bit annoyed with myself because it was showing results, but I know that feeling annoyed doesn't help and is based on deluded identification in the first place. I just notice that those thoughts and feelings do pop up anyway. I have noticed that beneath the backlash, even in days of brainfog and bodily pain, there is still a sense of peace. It's like there is a big enough part of all the processes, constituting the accessible experience, that doesn't really buy into the whole identification thing. When I tune into that, there is spaciousness and nada sound and a sense of complete silence being always present. Other parts still do buy into it, and they struggle with motivation not just for practice but for basically anything useful. Those parts are dopamine junkies. It probably doesn't help that I often forget to take my ADHD medication. They seem to fight for survival, for no meaningful purpose at all. They mess up life, getting us into downward spirals. It's basically my old coping mechanisms for really bad times. All they do is passing time, to make it bearable for another moment. It's netflix, mindless games on my ipad, food cravings (and anything outside of a strict anti-histamine autoimmune paleo diet really clogs up my energy channels and causes lots of illness symptoms), and online second-hand shopping (more than I can really afford and more than I have use for, just for the kick of the bargain; I give some of it away). Ah, now the deluded identification thoughts pop up again, with guilt and shame! Not helpful, thankyou very much. What really does help is starting the day with yoga, especially those mornings when it feels like it would be too much because of the bodily pain and stiffness (due to the wrong foods and poor sleep). It really does help. It takes away the stiffness and pain and clears away the brainfog and makes it easier to breathe again (which makes it more enjoyable to do shamatha on the breath). Yoga makes me motivated to practice and to make myself useful. Practice was easier when I had the accountability of the yoga studio that I loved, that is, before it was bankrupted due to covid. I need to build a solid habit on my own. So - first thing in the morning. And as a replacement for the dopamine-seeking behavior as much as I can. I'm not sure how to implement that last part. Replace all those behaviors for the main part of the day every day and completely one day per week? Focus on one behavior at a time and do it cold-turkey? I think making small but consistent changes is most likely to succeed. I know from experience that they tend to create positive spirals. They will take away the sense of needing the bad habits. Thoughts pop up that I really shouldn't have these issues when I'm on the path. I don't need to believe those thoughts. Apparently the issues do exist, and the path is apparently happening too. That's just the way it apparently is. Now I'm off to make myself useful. Yay yoga!",

        "msg": "February 2022 Some reflections: I notice a general tendency of being able to handle the small challenges in life better, which has also led to some rather surprising changes in what I find possible and how I choose to spend my time. Nothing revolutionary, just unexpected. I find myself doing some things for fun that earlier in life would make me Donald Duck angry, if you know what I mean. Furious with frustration. It never would have occurred to me that I would just pick it up without even thinking much about it. Like, hey, those are some really nice yarns and hey, here's a waving frame for sale - it might be fun to weave myself some simple dharma images while listening to dharma talks. And then just do it. And I do just as many mistakes as I would have done earlier in life, and I have to start over several time, but there's no drama to it. I just find what early mistake caused all the problems and start over from there, over and over again, slowly and with calm, and I gradually learn from the mistakes. At one point, after several repeated mistakes that were a bit complicated to resolve, I noted that my body temperature was rising a tad and so I took off a sweater until the temperature was back to normal and I put it on again. It dawned on me that I had a physical symptom from frustration, but I felt absolutely no frustration whatsoever. It made me giggle. And then I have a day or so when frustration levels are back to how they used to be, and holy fucking fuck, that's just not a worthy life! I'd rather die than having to live like that all the time, so invested in such a narrow little point which somehow manages to get itself so totally entangled in all sorts of threads weighed down by heavy burdens while at the same time missing most of what is going on in the space around it for no plausible reason at all. That's where the doubt comes in. Did I just imagine all of it? Or have I somehow done some fatal mistake that erases all the change that occurred from the path moments? That doesn't last long, though, because it is very easy to reality check. The lasting changes (described earlier in my logs - e.g., autistic stress responses from eye contact totally gone, disabling sensitivities to sensory input basically gone too, some phobias gone, and improved relationships as well as new professional talents due to lots of reactivity gone) are indisputable. It seems to rather be the case that the remaining issues stand out more and the heaviness of them is so much more noticable than before, and therefore what used to be normal feels unbearable. I recently noticed that my old fear of giving oral presentations is completely gone now. It's not just managable or weighed up by its meaningfulness, or diminished by very consciously reminding myself that it's not about me (a realization that I made before I took up a meditation practice; in retrospect it is easy to see why it was the most helpful approach I had ever tried) as was the case when I got over the extremely limiting phobia in the first place, about a decade ago. It just isn't there at all. I don't think the thought even occurs that there's a me there while the presentation is ongoing. Or maybe it does, but significantly less and without that buying into it that used to be the default mode. It is really so much easier to give a presentation without having to deal with all that identity and image stuff and all the fears inherent to that, all the things that made it so messy and sticky. The presentation just does its own thing. No fuzz. No mess. Nothing to dwell on in retrospect. I continue to surprise the people closest to me, in positive ways. And yet I often feel that it's a great struggle. The contrasts between equanimity and non-equanimity are jarring. The moments when there is resistance to the here and now are just dreadful. I think I'm more compassionate about it nowadays, like I don't demand more from myself than I would from others, even at times when I do buy into the selfing stuff in a way that reifies what is actually just a transient flow. Somehow I always know at some level that the personal stories are empty, and the lesser entanglement in identification makes it easier to see clearly what helps and what doesn't. Some things aren't worth getting invested in, because The Huge Issue is but a mirage that will be long gone the next day. It still sucks when it sucks, though. Impermanence is a blessing.",

        "msg": "I have realized that I have been doing both lite jhanas and what Culadasa calls luminous jhanas, and that I tend to see only the latter ones as jhanas in my own practice, because they stand out so much clearer and feel more helpful. I feel a bit lost when it comes to the lite jhanas. The instructions for the progression of them are often vaguer. Lite first jhana is pretty easy to access, but the rest of them I'm not so sure about as to what is what, and that makes it more difficult to tune into them. With the luminous jhanas, the progress is super clear. There are no doubts as to what is what or how to time anything. The problem is that it requires a lot of momentum for me to get there, as my mind isn't enough welltrained to leave all the hindrances aside in-between daily life challenges. I rarely manage to fit retreat time into my life, and I made the mistake of not keeping it up when I did have easy access to the luminous jhanas. The plan is to gradually build up to that again, but to also learn to navigate the lite jhanas, for health purposes and above all to keep the pathways open as a way to deal with hindrances. I want to be able to follow Malcolm's advice and \"zap\" the dullness with some jhana. I get it now, and yeah, when it works it really works. So here are some questions for those with a jhana practice: - What would you say is the difference between lite 4th jhana and luminous 4th jhana? - How do you recognize when you shift from one jhana to the next in the lite versions? (Note: with the luminous jhanas I already know, so I'm specifically asking about the lite ones.) - Can you share some advice on how to get into lite 4th jhana? - How would you describe the experience of lite 4th jhana? For me 4th jhana takes one of these two shapes: - Vipassana: distinct chrystal clear and super-focused neutrality. All vedana is gone and yet it is so incredibly beautiful, in a detached way and yet with full presence. No sense of doing anything but witnessing. There is lightness and spaciousness, and gravity is gone. Sacred geometry made out of light appears with perfect clarity (what starts as static snow in first or second jhana gradually clusters together to constellations and then transforms into art works - mostly flat but sometimes threedimensional, and on rare occasions \"4th screen\" with full interactivity with a threedimensional environment). Vipassana still happens on its own. The body is dissolved into an energy field if there at all. Full immersion. The outer world is gone. - Shamatha: as the first four sentences above, but instead of the sacred geometry and the vipassana still happening, there is full absorption with the nimitta to the extent that everything is bright white. There is nothing else except from that bright whiteness and the light spaciousness and the vedana-free chrystal clarity. No body at all. Bright white is the only aspect of form. I have sometimes experienced something that I have classified as jhana 3,5. Maybe that\u2019s the lite version? Compared to the versions described above, it\u2019s kind of \u201dmeh\u2026\u201d. It didn\u2019t stand out as clearly and lacked the full absorption. The clarity was there and vedana fell away, but it wasn't quite as chrystal clear and it wasn't luminous in that transcendental way. I have been wondering why 4th jhana is so hard to access. Here it seems like many practicioners get there fairly easily. Then again, many here have been at it for a long time and done lots of retreats, and most of them probably don't have ADHD, so I probably set the bar for myself unrealistically high. Anyhow, it seems like it might be a good idea to learn how to access some version of it more readily. I know that it is possible. So... help?",

The issue now is that it isn't stable enough to focus on for the purpose of full absorption. So - work on the access concentration, I guess. Another issue is that I run out of bliss before I'm satisfied with it. That is probably another sure sign that I need to work on the access concentration, right? And the hindrances, of course. The qualities of a lite fourth jhana are very close to awake awareness, right? Except that it's not a state of absorption at all, but the mind as it is when delusion is stripped away. I do tune into those qualities in daily life as often as I can and when it happens on its own, which it does as a grace. It feels like being able to navigate into an absorption with them would clear the pathways more so that the natural mind would be less hampered with hindrances. I don't know if that's true.",

When I do get into third, there is still the issue of having enough access concentration to stay there (as I wrote above). When access concentration is strong enough for hours of jhana, which has happened before (in the review phase efter second path), then I haven't gone as far as to being able to control duration. I would just cycle the arch over and over again for hours, including the formless jhanas and a fruition (always the suffering door). It was kind of weird and I guess it scared me off from shamatha for quite some time. The nada sound just kept drawing me in.",

        "msg": "I dreamed some pointers. In the dream I tuned into the kind of surrender that I used to bask in, and it took me to fourth screen. It was so easy. I have been practicing it today while focusing on the breath at the entrance of the nostrils. The breath is starting to solidify into a soft ball at the tip of the nose, and the mind is getting all light and airy while the nada sound gets louder and louder. I can feel energy building up in the body but I continue to get back to the narrow focus to build up the access concentration. With that surrender it doesn't get boring. Thankyou, dream! This is going to sound nuts, but I think I have found a connection between spiritual energy and histamines. I'm histamine intolerant. When I did the practice leading up to stream entry, I had bodily pain as soon as the energetic champagne bubbles weren't there. I though of it as stagnated energy. Since then I have been better and better at avoiding the foods that cause the pain, which has been a great relief, but the sense of strong energy moving around in my body has also been absent. Now I have found that when I eat something that is fairly rich in histamines or that makes the body produce its own histamines (but not too much, because that knocks me out), the pain comes back together with the sense of energetic flow (not at the same time, but as each other's flip sides). So - with just the right dosis, I can use the histamine-induced bodily pain as fuel for the practice and get all flowy. Histamine is a neurotransmittor, after all, so it sort of makes sense that a critical amount is needed.",

        "msg": "Thanks for replying! Well, I too often do not have unwavering attention to the breath right now. Hindrances appear. Call it what you want, but I need to do something about it. Or stop doing what I'm doing. I don't have a welltrained mind. I've had quite a lot of flukes. In many ways I'm still a beginner. The hindrances can get pretty strong. Also, at times when I do have access to jhana, it does seem to me that if I enter jhana too soon, it doesn't take me all the way, so spending more time on the threshold to get concentration stronger before turning to the handle seems to be a good idea. What do you think about that? Since I'm still working towards third, I probably do make a thing out of awake awareness, but what I meant sounds a whole lot like what you just said, so thanks for validating that! Hopefully I'll be able to let go of any remanining reification as I go along. Hm. Maybe I do lean towards vipassana, and maybe it does get too dry. Weirdly enough, I haven't considered that possibility. I actually prefer the vipassana jhanas to the shamatha jhanas, but it makes sense that they would get too dry too. I do believe that I have a hard time letting go of noticing change. Why I can't just stay with pleasant feelings? Hindrances. I guess I'm a bit of a masochist. I don't know. But yeah, smudging things together with the breath sensations is an advice I usually give, so I should probably just follow it. Yes, it fizzles out, after a long time of remaining subtle energetic movement. Jhanas were easier when I really just wanted out. I could spend hours soaking in inner refuge with no drive to do anything else whatsoever. I guess the ego thinks that it has something to lose now.",

I can\u2019t do it with the kind of precision you are talking about, but I do understand some of it. I have moved subtler energies and find that it causes less body symptoms. It makes sense that only the grosser manifestations of energy would need neurotransmittors. I didn\u2019t intend to bring those back. It happened by accident as I tried some foods that I have been avoiding for a long time, and it caught my curiosity. Interestingly, it also brought back the dukkha \u00f1ana energy stagnation pain and the grosser vibrations. With the latter in place, I noted that the reobservation throat vibrations are still gone, but instead there are similar gross vibrations in the heart chakra and the sacred chakra respectively at different points in the cycling, but only very briefly. I would guess that some contraction happens there - something to work with. I definitely do not have your experience with energy work, so I appreciate your input.

I was abroad somewhere, hangin out with an afroamerican woman whom I had encountered while waiting for a bus or something. She has made contact, asking some stuff and eventually asked me and the other person (possibly the fictive partner from the previous dream) whether we sing. We replied and there were some follow-up questions, and then I asked her \"Do you sing?) - and she burst out into singing as a response. She had the most amazing voice, so strong and so rich, and she was singing about racism (which I somehow knew without actually hearing specific words). My face was all wet with tears. Then we kept hanging out, and the other companion was all forgotten. The scenery shifted a lot without any clear idea of how I got there. I didn't find that strange, but I did note that I wouldn't be able to find my way back alone (which is not unique in any way as my sense of direction leaves a lot to be desired). I have no idea what \"back\" would be, but in the dream I didn't find that strange. Eventually we arrived at some place where the woman was living, and there were some strange rules there which I can't recall. I remember being concerned about them and commenting on it in Swedish. The woman, who was English-speaking, replied as if she had understood. I commented on that, and we both thought it was weird. Then it happened again, and she even spoke in Swedish. We discussed how this could be possible and I said \"This must be a dream\". To confirm that, she changed appearance. She looked Swedish too (blonde and white) and I/we concluded that it definitely was a dream. I then shifted focus to staying lucid while staying in the dream. I said that her previous look was more becoming, but that I liked her anyway. Then I added \"You aren't even real , but I like you anyway\", which we both thought was funny. I looked around a lot, without staring to long on one specific object. It was all rich in detail and fascinatingly solid-looking. I was exploring the environment for quite some time. The place was messy and filled with curious objects, such as a tiger head statue. After a while I noticed that the visuals were starting to dissolve somewhat, so I did what I have heard/read can be helpful: I spinned around in the dream to make sensory inputs more stimulating. It worked. I continued to explore. I was also contemplating the confabulatory nature of my experiences in the dream up to the point of getting lucid. Then, however, I got lost in cravings, which made the dream dissolve and so I woke up.",

Sometimes that's a miracle. - spontaneity movement practice, brief check-ins: I'm amazed by how it opens things up and how much joy and pleasure are so readily available, and how it embodies confidence and faith. - chanting together with upper body dance (spontaneity): It just feels soooo good. I have come across rock fusion hindu chants that are very inspiring. Armonian is the band - check it out! I'm not a hindu, but right now there is a strong pull towards the symbolisms of Shiva and Kali for some reason. It resonates. - sun salutations: My energy body and my physical body both love it. - a brief session of anti-depressant Kundalini yoga, simple and gentle: It really does something. - heart rate variability resonant breathing, first ten minutes at the speed of 3,5 breaths per minute, then ten minutes of 3 breaths per minute. It's supposed to make you relax, and it does, but for me it also energizes as I normally breath slower than that during meditation in stillness. - Aum chanting in each chakra: I just learned how to do this, and it's amazing. When the chanting finds the chakra for real, it resonates in a totally different way. There can be no doubt whatsover as to whether or not it was the right spot. It just opens up, and the overtones grow exceptionally clear and strong, like chrystal glass flutes playing harmonies. The opening up is very tangible, kinesthetically, and it really feels like the sound clears away old gunk until the chakra is pure. Note to self: make this a regular part of the practice! - feeling my true intent vibrate through the central channel and resonate in the chakras: This happened as I read a post here at DhO (by SigmaTropic - thanks!) right after doing the chanting in the chakras. I so needed that. It washed away anxiety and self doubts. I still can't express my intention in words, but now I know that I don't need to. I know that it's pure and vibrant and strong.",

After some time of spontaneity movement I felt like some karaoke chanting, which I did, together with some more spontaneity movement which felt great for the energy body. Then I did yoga: sun salutations with intermittent spontaneous movement, then a flow for the upper body to release the shoulders, then a flow for balance. Then I felt like getting some things done at home for the first time since... quite a while? My executive functioning is back online! And the spontaneous movement keeps happening intermittently. I so look forward to doing more practice today, now that the resistance is gone. I think I'll do the sequence of spontaneous movement + antidepressant Kundalini yoga + HRV resonance breathing + Aum chanting in the chakras again, and then sit for a length of time to see what happens.",

        "msg": "The day before yesterday I didn't get to doing that entire program that I had intended because of daily chores that needed to be done when I finally had gotten the energy to do them, but I did some more HRV resonance breathing, some more of the movements, and some Aum chanting in the chakras. The latter didn't hit the bullseye like before but still felt good. Then I had an hour of one-on-one dharma guidance, which is not something that I have had much of, and getting to have that does wonders for motivation. After that I did some more of the movement part of the practice. Then a partner arrived and I prioritized spending some quality time with him (we live in different towns with a few hours between us and we both have difficulties getting somebody to watch our cats). Yesterday morning I did half an hour of chanting and tuning-into-intention movements. During the day I revisited the movements and went on a barefoot walk in the woods. In the early evening I did an hour and a half of gentle yoga, then 45 minutes of gentle Kundalini yoga, 15 minutes of HRV breathing and a few minutes of Aum chanting in the chakras which I had to interrupt prematurely because it was time for my weekly an hour zoom meeting with two dharma friends from the RtS course. What I had been doing for 3 hours was intended as a prelude to a longer sitting in stillness, but I sort of lost track of time. During the meeting I noticed some great effects, so I believe a sit would have been great there, but getting to talk about the practice with my dharma friends probably also contributed to those effects - which were a sense of lightness and spaciousness and subtle clarity. During the yoga my sinuses had popped open from being contracted. I had some food, which contained minimal amounts of corn starch (should have known better). Then I did reclining body scanning. I know that lying down is a bad choice with regard to dullness, but I wasn't dull at all when I started, but felt energized. The scanning started out great. It woke up vibrational vividness in the body parts respectively. It was fun to note that the part of the body that I was focusing on would stand out as a larger field, and that this enlargening would move around as my attention moved. Then the corn starch kicked in and I got dull. I managed to get back on track a few times, but then I fell asleep (way before my usual bedtime) and slept through the night (no need for sleeping pills here, ever, as a minimal amount of corn start would suffice). This morning I woke up early enough but foggy and with body pain. I recited a refuge prayer in English while listening to Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche singing it beautifully in Tibetan. I had a small breakfast and some ayurvedic tea while doing some tuning-into-intention movements and chanting the refuge prayer in Tobetan and then repeating it in English. It includes tuning into one's energy body and a passage of having all clouds of misery completely cleared away by the wisdom wind, so it seems very spot on. The brain fog has dissipated now and the remaining body pain is very mild. Now I plan to do some gentle yoga and Kundalini yoga, efter replying to Arena and having some more tulsi tea.",

        "msg": "Loooong lucid dream. It felt like a couple of hours went by. I went back to sleep in the morning for the purpose of getting lucid, without doing anything else special. I don't even know how I got lucid. I just suddenly did without any specific dream signs. I had been travelling with a partner, but I kind of ditched him when I realized that it was a dream. Instead I floated around and explored the surroundings. Lots of detailed scenery. When it started to fade, I spinned around to make it more vivid. At some point I went to a high point and stepped out in the air to challenge myself, and from that point I was flying. I tried moving my arm through solid objects, which worked. Temptations would arise and I said no to them, insisting that I wanted awakening. I made some pain happen in the dream for the purpose of seeing theough it. The pain was real but empty. I decided to go under water and breathe there, which I did. The visuals there were lacking, however, as my imagination was too limited. Sometimes I just floated around in some rather empty surrounding with some texture to it and some manifestations of light. I tried going to Lama Lena but didn't know where to go. Sometimes there was a pull which I followed in trying to find her. For a while I saw some scenery that could have been mountains in India. Then I remembered that she is travelling to Europe (too bad that I can't physically go to Amsterdam on such a short notice), and I hesitated as to where to \"aim\". I kept following the pull but never reached her. For a while I conjured up some offerings to symbolically present to her. I also put my hands together at my chest in angeli mudra, which felt weird because I suddenly had to have a body. Whenever I repeated to myself that I wanted to awake, things got brighter and more energetic. Sometimes that would also happen when I intended to search for Lama Lena. I did some freefalling for the purpose of letting go. I'm not sure about the order of things, just mention them as I recall them. What eventually woke me up was someone whistling repeatedly (I had the door open to my patio, but I'm not sure whether someone was whistling out there or whether that was a regular dream interfering. I started to dream that I was waking up, in some other place than \"for real\", and anachronistically. So it was rather the case that I got less lucid. However, gradually I remembered where I was actually sleeping and retained lucidity while gradually waking up.",

I have definitely not been a perfect parent. I used to be very sensitive to stress, for instance, which would manifest as irritability. I didn't get my diagnoses until I already had my kid. I have gone through quite a developmental journey both in learning to understand my own needs and seeing through them when applicable. I tried neglecting my own needs for the benefit of my kid and that didn't work very well, so instead I tried to set an example for my kid to stand up for oneself and taking one's own needs seriously. Unfortunately the rest of society still makes a too convincing case that some needs (specific to neurominorities) must be imagined, so we are struggling with that. At the same time, the practice has made me realize that there are some totally different needs that really are imagined (not the ones specific to neuromonorities, but very commonly experienced needs), and letting go of those in relationship with my kid has worked miracles. -- Today my work has given me the opportunity to do some of the movement practice in water, which was well needed and felt great. It has also given me great opportunities for sympathetic joy.",

It's hard to tell what is what in it, so I guess I need to deal with it on several different planes. Neglecting my yoga clearly doesn't help. Talking with dharma friends and teachers does make a difference, but apparently I still needed to sweat it out physically, which I did this night after the RtS class and after some Aum chanting in the chakras. I don't know what role increased intake of 5-htp had in getting myself out of bed this time, if any, but I'll certainly consider biochemistry as a relevant component together with others.

        "msg": "It seems that I give the impression of being more thorough and consistant in my practice than I have been lately, and I want to change that. Both sides of it. I don't want to give false impressions. I also really do want to live up to the impression that I have apparently been given falsely. I think being totally upfront about my difficulties might help with that, mainly because it gives my subconscious a clear message that I really do want to work with myself and that a genuine process is much more important than my self-image as well as other people's image of me. I haven't lied. I just haven't had the energy to give updates when my practice has been neglected, for the same reason that I have neglected the practice: lack of executive functioning and energy. Writing updates can feel overwhelming, and that tends to coincide with when practice also feels overwhelming. Because of that, the impression gets skewed. So people who say you're impressed with me - don't be! I'm totally messed up a lot of the time, really. I can be very constructive when I have the energy for it and when I'm not paralyzed by anxiety or overwhelmed, but I have to budgetize lots of totally unproductive time for that to happen once in a while. The truth is that I have been close to a burnout lately, except for sudden spikes of energy now and then, and my ability to focus generally sucks a lot of the time. I do think that almost-burnout manifests differently now compared to before (I have had a few burnouts throughout my life, so I have data for comparisons, so to speak). It is more transient and less solid, which can be rather confusing. The signs that I'm used to watching out for aren't there in the same way. The signs that are there behave differently. Other signs appear that I wouldn't have noticed before, and that can be confusing too. I think there's a risk for many of us to neglect our basic needs when this kind of development happens, so please watch out for that if it's applicable to you, and take care of yourself! My short-term memory has been on strike now and then lately. Like there is no processing power left at all for short-term memory to function. And then suddenly it works again. It's weird. I recently made the commitment to for at least one month start and end every day with a specific practice that I keep changing my description of. Devotinal movements is not quite accurate. Spontaneity movements isn't entirely accurate either, but both say something important about it. Embodying intention feels close to it, although it's more of a process of tuning into it than of expressing it. If there is even a difference there. They certainly overlap. I doesn't feel like intention really foregoes expression. It's more like they are one and the same, an expression that comes to life with the intention built into it. Except when I fake it. That sucks. When I do it because I should, because that will bring about something. There's no magick in that. And I know that faking it until you make it has its points in many contexts, but I'm not always sure when it's applicable and when it's not. I'm prone to just skipping the faking. That's the point I was trying to get to: I haven't started and ended every day with that specific practice. I think that I have had some aspect of it happen every day, but the intensity and the involvement have varied, and the times of the day/night have varied as well. I'm still committed to having it integrated into my practice as a default, because I know that it does something. Honestly, I haven't even had formal practice sessions every day lately, because sometimes I can barely manage to do my job and other duties that I can't neglect. I don't know what time span \"lately\" refers to. I think there might be phases to it and that it varies enormously. I think I have a serotonine deficiency right now and that it effects my memory and my sense of time together with my executive functioning and my general drive. I recently (?) changed to a different brand of a supplement, but now I have changed again, so I think it will be under control soon (yes, I do take antidepressants as well, and yes, my psychiatrist is aware that I combine the medicines with the supplements). Sometimes I just can't get out of bed for the practice. To some extent, that has been good for my dream yoga. However, it's definitely not good for dealing with dullness. I think that less than two weeks ago it felt like everything was shaping up again. It feels like it is on its way to shape up again now as well. So maybe \"lately\" is a very short timespan? I don't know. All developments seems so extremely transient. Is even the narrative in this post true by the time I'll post it? I don't know. It's all falling apart, it seems. And yet, in a while, it probably doesn't feel like that either. Is it supposed to be like this? I think I have gone through the entire PoI cycling of the \u00f1anas several times while trying to write this even, but this doesn't feel like review. It's just how transient and fragmented experience is, I'd say. But I also remember that the last time I had this kind of experience of time falling apart and everything being completely transient, I had in fact run out of that supplement, so maybe it's just a symptom of brain dysfunction. Or maybe it's how brain dysfunction looks from a lens of some amount of awakening. I guess even brain dysfunction can be meditated upon as a means for awakening, just like all other challenges. It's important not to confuse what is what, though. It seems like it should be obvious what is what, but it really is incredibly entangled. That says a lot about the extent to which we fabricate our experience, doesn't it? Fabrications can go on strike for medical reasons. I would prefer other means for deconstructing them, and I'll do my best to cure any such medical reasons, but while I'm waiting for the healing I might as well use it as a possibility for seeing through the fabrications. I do stop everything and just tune into something (no words for expressing it feel correct right now) very often. I guess it's what Lama Lena would half-jokingly call checking to see if my mind is still there. Not the small mind, but the big mind (which is not a thing). And it is. To the extent that \"is\" is even applicable, which I don't really think it is. She has a favorite quote about that (of whom I can't remember): it's where the is:s and isn't:s aren't (I don't know how to write out the plural forms of \"is\" and \"isn't\" turned into nouns). I'm confused about most things, it seems, but I do get that. Just don't ask me to explain it. Still suffering as fuck all too often, it seems, so don't confuse my confusion for some breakthrough, please. It's a fucking mess. Okay, that's reobservation again. And now it's gone. Oh my goodness, what a lovely weather! Wow. Peace in my heart, just like that. For a while, haha. See? How am I even supposed to write updates when it's like this? I think I'll go out and meditate on a blanket in the sun. Can't guarantee that it will happen before everything changes again, though.",

        "msg": "Excerpt from an email update: I guess for me it\u2019s hard to separate practice-related difficulties from life-related difficulties. It\u2019s not so much that I\u2019m occupied with thoughts about life, but rather that it affects me energetically (and the other way around as well - the practice does also change how I approach life). It might be fair to say that my difficulties are mainly related to animal realm issues. I get into survival mode, which includes doing what I can to want to survive, or at least to not want to not survive when it\u2019s at its worse. The coping strategies for that tend to be rather ignorance-prone, because the world feels overwhelming. The last week when I have had to keep Morpheus the cat inside to overlook his diet, I have been stuck inside as well, and that messed up several of my more constructive coping strategies. It messed up my movement practice as well, because as soon as I moved, he got his hopes up that he would get more food. When I stay inside without moving around, I get dull. That messes up intentions too, because the dull pattern doesn\u2019t want to be more active. I have decided to get back to having the door open to the patio now, sooner than recommended by the vets, because it\u2019s so vital for my coping. Everything in my life is so intertwined. With the patio door open, the dynamics between my cats also improves, which makes it possible for me and Ezekiel (one of the other cats) to get back to meditating together, and I feel closer to the elements, which is also essential for my practice to work. I think I want to talk more about intention, or intent. It seems like a lot of people experience intent as something they decide upon cognitively, like a top-down thing, and even though in the practice we are all aiming at deconstructing that, at a pragmatic level it still seems to work for people to approach it like that. For me it doesn\u2019t. I need to approach it more bottom-up, sort of. That\u2019s a major part of what the movement practice is about. By changing the way I move, other patterns of intent become available. That\u2019s also part of why the patio is so important. I can\u2019t access the patio without moving the body, so already there I have changed something in the available patterns. Even small movements change something. I learned that several years ago when I was struggling with dissociation, which can make movement seem impossible. Moving a pinky finger is enough to send signals to the brain that movement is indeed possible and thus break a freeze spell, and it has never been so bad that I haven\u2019t been able to move a pinky finger (it works for sleep paralysis too). This is also why I have a long playlist with short morning yoga sessions. Even just 5 minutes of yoga make other patterns of intent available. So for me, tuning into intent is almost like archeology. I need to gently brush away all the dirt to uncover it. I can\u2019t aim directly at it. I need to aim at the first possible step of gentle brushing. And then all the turbulence around me covers it all up with dirt again. So I guess I need to keep brushing while the new dirt is still loose and easy to remove. Hm. Yeah, that makes sense, I think. And that\u2019s probably something that has room for improvement. Yeah. That\u2019s how my home gets cluttered up as well. So\u2026 I need to build strategies that makes it very easy to get back on track with the gentle brushing so that I\u2019ll get further than just uncovering the surface over and over again. The first step needs to be possible during practically any circumstances. Either that, or - and in my experience this usually works even better - I need to have many different possible simple first steps that all leed to the right track. Yes. That\u2019s what I need. So I guess this means that I also need to build connections from all those different first steps to new steps that lead me on the right path. That\u2019s something to work with!",

Speaking of child birth, today I discovered that hundreds (?) of tiny baby spiders had just been born on the doorsteps to my patio, one of my meditation places. It was beautiful. I wanted to bring nature into my patio, and it has succeeded. A hedgehog has spent the winter there, birds are nesting there, and at least three different ants civilizations live there down in the earth.

And yet there are feelings and thoughts about wanting to soothe and comfort that specific pattern. That's just misdirected. Okay, this does something. There's still grief that the pattern that is suffering can't be made to not suffer. Applying the same understanding to that reaction. That does something too.

First I just sat, then it developed into zhine with support as my eyes were drawn to a magnificent iris flower in bloom. The world felt dreamlike. Then I did Kundalini yoga, ending with a short meditation involving mental hearing of \"sat nam\". I observed the different degrees to which subvocalizing was involved and how that felt. Then I did a gentle yoga flow to take care of my body in a mindful way, which was very much needed. After that I lay down in Shivasana. I started with a body scan but got dull and forgot about it. I got back on track with it, but got dull again, got back on track and got dull again. I have been recommended to do body scanning to prevent dullness, but for some reason lately it has the opposite effect on me (this isn't the first time; it has happened repeatedly). I wonder what that's about. It didn't have that effect on me before, not at all. Maybe there's a blind spot somewhere. It might be something to investigate. Perhaps taking my ADHD medz would help too. Around 8 o'clock I allowed myself to take a nap on the yoga mat before I got up again and had breakfast. Then I did the antidepressant Yi Rang on my way to work, walking through the woods. There were lots of beings, human and other kinds, to rejoice with.",

I prefer to work with that and very regularly check in with it. There's got to be something else. I do notice resistance to the systematicity of the scanning. There's a preference to just letting the focus wander the way it wants. Would that lead to less dullness? More? A similar amount? I'll guess I'll have to check. But now I need to get back to working.

        "msg": "Okay, interesting. I haven't got enough data for any statistical analysis, but my working hypothesis is that it is something in the systematicity of body scanning that leads to dullness for me. I just did some testing, 20 minutes of reclining meditation, tuning into body sensations without the systematicity. It was after both work and housecleaning and at a time when my ADHD medication starts to leave the body. Yet I wasn't dull at all. On the contrary, it was a very energizing session. There was a vibrant presence. So, I don't know how much of it has to do with cycling the dukkha \u00f1anas where a broader approach usually works better than a narrow one, but it seems that a more holistic and more intuitive approach works better for me than a disciplined approach systematically focusing on one narrow spot at a time. It's possible that it has to do with my wiring. Less executive functioning is required when the process gets to follow its own inclinations. Maybe I have a partial burnout in the left brain. Where is NiNurta? I'd appreciate some feedback here, Ni. Is it okay to just let the process decide which neurons to use, or is there a point to doing it manually? It seems to me that the process knows how to put the fresh ones to work instead of the exhausted ones, without any illusory active directing from a self construct, so I'm inclined to letting it do that. Notes: Just dropping into full body awareness feels a bit like sinking into a nice bubble bath. Lots of sensations basically everywhere, happening effortlessly. There's a sense of it all knowing itself. It's got to be what Daniel and others refer to, because it's the best way I can describe it. The sensations synch up in a way that makes subject and object duality dissolve. Where two body parts touch each other, when synched up like that, the idea of one part sensing the other feels like an unnecessary detour. The sensations are known to themselves, immediately and directly where they are. Inner and outer collapses. Wherever there are sensations, there I am. The Physics theories suggesting that all our experienced world is really projected information, like a hologram, make perfect sense. Thus in this mode the notion that sensations need to travel through nerves to the brain is just total bullshit. The mind is \"out there\". Withing the framework of this holistic knowing, the attention is still operating. It sweeps through the body like a magnifying glass, making one field at a time stand out more, and within that field the same occurs at smaller scales - fractals. Together with that process, occuring on perhaps an endless numbers of levels (turtles all the eay down), there is also another process going on that bounces back and forth between the left side of the body and the right side. I believe there are fractals to that as well. The slowest rhythm that I can detect feels like a gentle wave. When the holistic mode is in place, I can do more systematic scanning if that intention occurs, but it feels very different: more organic, more 3D, more nondual, more effortless. I scanned through my body to make sure that I wasn't missing something. Then I let the fractal processes operate on their own. It both feels better and seems more efficient. The sensations are richer. I think that something that holds me back is some delusional idea that I should be able to control my mind better by now. Not sure how that idea got so infectuous. I didn't have it when I started my daily practice, so in this sense I have been going backwards. How silly! After all, it is very clear that things work much better without trying to sit in the driver's seat. Surrendering to the process served me well before, so why try to change that? If anything, there should be less sense of control now, not more.",

It's probably true that the precise and narrow scanning develops other qualities. Still, I think I need to approach even that within a larger framework of nonduality for it to work for me. It seems that with systematic narrow scanning, I get dull regardless of whether I recline or sit, and even from just ten minutes while sitting up. On the other hand, I just did more than an hour of holistic tuning into body sensations reclining, late in the evening, without getting dull. I think I'll work from there, leading with my strengths. I have very little retreat experience. Earlier in the evening I did some more yoga.",

This was the foggy version of it rather than the clear one, so more subconscious and less energetic manifestations. I noticed a cycle to it in which a veil would lift itself regularly. I remember verbal thoughts popping up about how some specific state couldn't exist independently of anything else. I also remember noticing something that thought it had to hold it all (my experience?) together. I have had previous encounters of something similar where I could let go of it and find new levels of relaxation, both physically and energetically, which would open things up perceptually and emotionally as well. That didn't happen here. It was more of a surprise reaction happening that took me back to the surface. I'm not sure what the surprise was about. Maybe the knot was somewhere I didn't expect. Maybe it wasn't ready to be seen. I really don't know. It didn't seem very sturdy, though, but kind of fragile. Like a thin cord encompassing a huge bundle of things.",

        "msg": "Yesterday was dull. I think I need to distinguish between different kinds of brain fog, either that or reserve the term fog for something specific. The fog described the day before yesterday is something that I used to experience as solid but no longer do. Seeing through it really feels like when a fog dissipates.The sleepiness of yesterday is a whole different... beast (that's a colorful expression - thanks Smiling Stone!). I still don't know to what extent that kind of sleepiness is just resistance to awakening and what is lack of sleep and/or medical issues. I did have both medical reasons (hubris with regard to my diet as well as lots of pollen and too little allergy medication) and too little sleep yesterday. I still suspect that it would be possible to approach it more skillfully, to distinguish the resistance from the basic human needs that shouldn't be bypassed. I did yoga, mainly yin yoga but also some gentle \"yang\" flows. I sat, but when I just kept falling asleep sitting up in spite of several attempts at staying awake, I took a break from ot and eventually a nap. I had tried keeping my eyes open, rolling my eyes to flood my perception with sensory input, and making some movements. I could have tried more strategies, but I didn't (well, maybe I tried something that I have now forgotten, but for instance I didn't try standing meditation). And after the nap, I indulged in StarTrek and started reading a great book (from our own Tim Farrington, nonetheless, and that certainly peaked my interest enough not to fall asleep). While I do think that the nap was probably a good call (and the bookreading too, because it's an exquisite book!), I also think that I'm too much of a dopamine junkey to be free a lot of the time, and I probably need to let go of some of my soft intuitive approach to get over that threshold again as I did before. Otherwise gunk assembles and gets in the way of the intuition. It's hard, because treating myself to dopamine has been a coping strategy for so long, and without it, quite frankly, life can feel utterly miserable. I think I'll try to deal with dull days with short chunks of utter dedication interspersed with a softer approach. Not too much to maintain, but those dedicated chunks will be holy. That worked well in the past.",

        "msg": "I tried now a session separated into two parts. 20 minutes dedicated to alert presence to all experience, and efter that allowing the disentangling go on beneath the surface while resting. Report from the first 20 minutes: lots of movement going on in the mind, mainly at a less conceptual level. At first it felt like the whole world was rocking back and forth, like in a hammock. It wasn't dull, but sharp and vivid. Then it was that familiar sense of tentacles sorting themselves out on a preconceptual level, while the movement of it was clearly experienced. Towards the end of those 20 minutes, there had been a few brief instances of subtle dullness as dreamlike material came to the surface, but there was no sense of just wanting out of experience. There was no temptation to just sink into unconsciousness, and I consider that progress. When the time was up, I let the process continue any way it wanted. I can't really say that I know what was going on, as it's hard to conceptualize, and I can't say that I was alert all the time, but I can say that I came out of it with vivid alertness. The nada sound is loud and I feel more alive, more motivated, and much less sleepy. I do remember attempts at making sense of something and I also remember letting go of that, time after time. It just didn't translate well. Trying to translate it seemed delusional and took me farther from what was going on. At some point there was something occurring that seemed like an ouroboros theme, although it was more abstract than a snake or a dragon biting its tail. Something did come together as a circle, joining beginning and end. I experienced it both visually and kinesthetically. What it was, I have no idea. I think this is some kind of healing process, maybe related to trauma, possibly at least somewhat similar to what Arena Heidi has described. Subconscious sessions like this have been reoccurring for me throughout my practice. I think I have often discarded them as failed attempts at something else, but I don't think I could do without them. I just need to balance them with conscious practice to make the dynamics work.",

I focused on impermanence, paying attention to all the \"gones\" in experience and noticing the illusory separation that occurs with every gone, which manifests as a microscopic blanking out, which is why - from the point of view of attention - experience at a high resolution from that point of view becomes like a field of statics, points that appear and vanish at high speed. It dawned on me that I don't have to gain any new insight from that particular practice for it to be meaningful (although of course I do welcome new insights with open arms - hear that, universe!), but it's therapeutic just to allow all that letting go and noticing how pleasant that can be (don't take that too literally either, universe!). (Me and the universe have a history of repeated miscommunication, so caveats may be needed.) Also, it doesn't get dull, and sometimes it can be helpful to have a go-to practice that doesn't get dull. Watching gones keeps the mind busy, as the \"data\" to process is infinite. Thus I can use it to counteract dullness when needed. It probably doesn't work when I really need to sleep or when there are medical reasons, but hopefully it works for substantial parts of the resistance to awakening. This was the practice the got me stream entry (or more specifically, merging with the gone to refrain from that microscopic separation blanking out and from the bouncing that it involved was what got me stream entry), so it's not like I expect it to be key to anything new. It's just a tool that I'm picking up again as something to fall back on as sort of a warm-up and maintenance thing, and as a feelgood exercise.",

Next 45 minutes just tuning into what goes on in the visual field. The resolution isn't as clear as it used to be, but it's developing. Not as granular yet as I know it can be, but getting there, and there's a stroboscope effect happening. The session as a whole started out with a subject-object duality which was quite annoying. It felt like the eyes had to do something every time the blanking out was due. After a while I could relax and just let that process occur on its own without trying to own the agency of it. It's different from the bouncing that I had to transcend for stream entry. The \"subjective point\", as I called it back then, doesn't pop up as something solid anymore. Instead it's more of a circular wave movement going on. It dawned on me that the oeroborus theme probably pertains to that. It has to do with something that goes on with the senses and the expansions and contractions involved in the duality-nonduality dance.

I have been experimenting with going back to a more \"normal\" diet that includes some amounts of seeds and grains and dairy and yeast, and it seems that it doesn't agree with the process at all. For some reason it seems to make my lazy and narrowminded and self-indulgent and downright miserable, not to mention the bodily pain and other physical symptoms. The mental part of it disperses when I get to talk to people within the dharma, but then it sneaks right back. I had a few amazing days before that, though, merging with the elements out in the nature. I seem to have developed a devotional dance of my own that incorporates something... schamanic? The synchronization of movement and breathing is essential in it, and it's very joyous. I can sort of feel the aura getting massage when I do it. So why don't I just do it, sluggish days like this? There's that darn resistance. It doesn't make sense. I do feel better now, after lots of rest, some disentangling and a session of yoga nidra. Unfortunately, I have procrastinated work the entire day so I will need to spend the evening doing administrative tasks instead of immersing myself in yoga and dance and long sits. At least now it feels like doing those administrative tasks is actually possible. Part of the sluggishness today is jet lag from taking the RtS class on California time, that is 2:30-4:00 am for me.

In that session I had the experience of being God, not as a continuous entity but as being newborn in every moment and clueless in a wonderful way. Really experiencing every moment as new without any previous conditioning (not saying that there was no conditioning, just that the experience was that there wasn't). There was nothing to regret, no guilt, no shame, no shoulds or shouldn'ts. Just this incredible joy of coming into being, and lots of curiosity in that joy. I suspect that the experience was very similar to what people often feel when they experience salvation. It didn't stick, but what an experience! I also used to experience such an abundance of curiosity in my practice. I guess I sort of took it for granted. Now it seems like it takes effort to cultivate it. Maybe the sense of curiosity taking effort is something to investigate with curiosity. It really is a curious thing. It doesn't add up.",

Some restlessness in the beginning, with discursive thoughts, about the writing among other things. Very little dullness. Lots of curiosity. The curiosity was mainly about what happens in experience when something is constructed as the foreground: (1) There was no nausea this time in combining the sense of the hands touching with the visual field, but I noticed taking measures to avoid the kind of tensions that I think may have caused it before. It has to do with how I approach the visual field with eyes closed. Even without putting touch in the foreground of it, it can sometimes feel nauseating, probably precisely because of the issue that this exercise is designed to address (unbalamce between attention and awareness). Even though I know that the seeing behind closed eyelids isn't done with the eyes but with the mind (that's over-simplifying both the differences and the commonalities seeing with eyes open vs closed, but I won't get into that now), I still often need to intentionally relax the eyes from trying to focus. Adding the layer of hands touching as foreground increases the complexity. Keeping both in experience at the same time, both zoomed in in comparison to other sensations, and one more so than the other, takes some concentration. With the door to my little garden open, sudden and/or loud sounds compete about the focus, and the sensations in my visual field behind closed eyelids without absorption can be very subtle. In trying to bring them closer to the foreground than the sounds, I sometimes slip into using attention rather than awareness. This creates two different kinds of tensions - the already mentioned problem with trying to focus the eyes and the tension between the designated foreground of the sense of the hands touching. Attention in the sense of a narrow detailed laserbeam-type and \"binary\" focus doesn't seem to be able to embrace that much of experience at the same time, and I suspect that the nausea I felt before was due to trying to make it so anyway. This time I could feel very clearly how my eyes de-focused and how the eyeballs were \"sucked back into their sockets\" with the muscles around them relaxed, and I noticed as so many times before that it doesn't in any way hamper the \"seeing\", but rather the opposite. It would be interesting to investigate further how different combinations of foreground-background and sense gates can elucidate glitches in the optimal usage of awareness and attention, if there is such a thing. (2) I got curious about a very specific kind of bouncing in experience. It's not the kind of bouncing that stood out so annoyingly clearly before stream entry. Or at least, my experience is not the same. If it is the same phenomenon, my interpretation differs a lot. The experiences have something in common, though: they both relate to a center. This time it does not feel like there is a center that is the subject that has the sensation of something that is an object; it's not the bouncing between subject and object, or that kazoo player that Daniel describes in MCTB2 (bouncing between the sensation as it is and the interpretation of it, with the annoying sense of having access to sensations only through the interpretation that is just a pale echo pf the real deal). The bouncing that got me curious this time was the sense of sensory input from the designated background causing a reverberation in the designated foreground sensations, very automatically. Chirps from birds and other sudden sounds would be followed by an intesification of the sense of the hands touching for the same duration but with a slight delay (except some times when there seemed to be no delay, as it was all merged in unity). Like there was an anchor to those sensations, and any movement that would draw the boat away from the anchor point would be followed by the countermovement of the anchor pulling it back again. The louder the sound, the stronger the reverberation of the touch sensations. (3) Then I got curious about the difference between the modes with the above bouncing and the mode without it. I played with inclining myself back and forth between those modes. I'm not sure about this, but it seems like in order to establish a sense of something in the foreground, this kind of bouncing needs to appear. The bouncing is essential to constructing a center, and that involves both spatiality and sequentiality. I suppose that might pertain to different senses of there being a center. I saw before (in stream entry) how a specific kind of bouncing constructed the sens of self as a subject perceiving objects, and this foreground anchor-bouncing does something as well. The anchor doesn't stand out as something that knows the other sensations, but it does stand out like some kind of reference point, a here to the there of the other sensations maybe, or maybe simply as an anchor (which may not necessarily involve a sense of here and there, can't say really). In the mode where that bouncing didn't occur, I don't think that there was any sense of there being a figure-ground, but I'll have to investigate that further.",

        "msg": "Interesting! In Adi's discord channel there was a question about whether choiceless awareness can be taken to jhana, something like that, and the answer that done correctly it will take you to Niroda Samapati (forgive me for the spelling, which is probably incorrect). The short discussion there and some tentative playing with it was full of key pieces to the puzzle for me. Among other things, it helped me see how I have been stuck in false polarization in trying to understand how various practices relate to each other. It also opened up to an intriguing hypothesis as to why shamatha practice can be such a struggle for me although I stumbled into the whole jhanic arc without trying to do shamatha. What if choiceless awareness is the easy way into jhanas for the aversive type?! I've got to experiment with that! I had to feel into it immediately and so I set the timer for 20 minutes as a minimum, but I got so into it that I completely forgot about the timer. As far as \"correct\" choiceless awareness goes, this was a failure mode sit, but a very interesting one. There is so much subtle grabbing going on in my mind, and some not so subtle grabbing as well. It was interesting to notice the difference between getting into a chain leading to birth and getting into a chain of liberation. So subtle differences in responses leading to such huge differences in outcomes. I mainly noticed differences in affective responses. I still haven't memorized the names of different steps in those chains, but I could see that vedana would often be brought in automatically but that building upon the vedana was optional. I noticed that when there was no building upon the vedana, there would be a little outburst of bliss. I also noticed that building upon that bliss was optional as well, and it dawned on me that that's where I go wrong when I fail to get into fourth jhana. That subtle little inclination to let the bliss be born. So that's how to incline oneself towards a specific jhana! So I played with letting go of that little inclination, and my experience definitely got closer to 4th jhana. More often, vedana would not automatically be brought in with sensory impressions. I wasn't absorbed enough to call it jhana (I set my bars pretty high, and that goes for \"vipassana jhana\" as well), but I would say that I was playing with and investigating some factors of it. I also recognized that this was how I stumbled into the jhanas in the first place. It was no coincidence, not some grace bestowed upon me out of the blue. I think most instructions for how to get into jhana are based on what works for the greed type practicioner. They are most likely to have an affinity for absorption, after all. Maybe that's why there is so little of that in the oldest texts. It seems to me that the historical Buddha was an aversive type practicioner. He probably stumbled over the jhanas too just by getting tired of the steps leading to birth, rather than by falling in love with the breath.",

        "msg": "I have had a couple of days with poor focus. While waiting for my little salary, I ate some foods that aren't included in my diet, because, well, I was hungry and the opportunity was there. I played a bit with letting go of the dullness rather than efforting through it. There's a little sweetspot available sometimes that allows that, in the midst of brain fog. Amazing that it's possible! But it's not like I can go from there to doing advanced exercises. I merely stay on that threshold, balancing. Now I'm in the fog, now I'm not. Now I am, now I'm not. It's like dropping a heavy veil. Really dropping it rather than lifting it. It habitually comes back, but it seems possible to eventually drop that habit entirely. I'm not saying that it would take away tiredness and lapses in focus, but there seems to be a layer to it that is just optional. I have also done some yoga and some spontaneous movement and some disentangling. I just spent an hour disentangling and really soaking in it. Ah, that was so well needed! I feel renewed. This very early morning (before I went to sleep), I attended an RtS class with Michael Taft. We are now working with the recognition sutras, translated and commented by Christopher Wallis. That's nondual tantra, Kashmir Shaivism. Michael doesn't necessarily agree with Wallis about the origin of the tradition being hindu, as it might be the case that both hinduism and Tibetan buddhism both got the influences from something that was prior to them. Since we have spent quite some time exploring Tibetan Buddhism before this, it's interesting to compare notes. We have only started this exploration, but so far it feels a bit like coming home. In reading Wallis's spiritual introduction to the book, I recognized a lot from my own log over the years. That was somewhat funny, because some of my classmates (and Michael too!) commented that those phrasings were overly sugarcoated and woo woo. And here I thought I was the aversive type and a bit of a tech nerd. It's very cool that the text has survived for so long, throughout all sorts of historical tumult and chaos, thanks to families who kept the tradition of retranscribing it on birch bark regularly over many generations so that it wouldn't be forgotten.

I find the concept of touch points describing large areas somewhat confusing, as each of those areas have a myriad of touch points, but okay, I did some heavy generalization there and tried not to be so perfectionistic about it. I chose a sequence of touch areas to shift focus between in a predetermined order, and I let the focus shifting begin. There was a bit of delay in the shifts a lot of the time, but there was improvement. I find that shifting focus deliberatly takes a great deal of effort, so both gross and subtle dullness arose. I managed to get back to the task over and over again, throughout the sit. The dullness increased when I tried to tune into more awareness while maintaining the deliberate focus shifts, so I had to go back to more attention in order to maintain the sequence. I wasn't able to play with different combinations of senses and increasing the complexity by adding more. There's definitely room for improvement there. I would guess that the ADHD makes this tricky, so repeating a structured exercise like this is probably very helpful. Context: health not at its best, as I'm still waiting for my tulsi delivery. My home feels a bit crowded as I have a visiting friend and I'm too introvert to fully appreciate the company the way it deserves. Did the exercise too late at night. Had only done a small amount of yoga today. I woke up with heavy brain fog today and pain basically everywhere, but it really helps to look at brain fog as a matter of tuning into a radio channel. It's not really fog, but rather the case that the mind is only partly tuned into consensual reality while at the same time also partly tuned in somewhere else, like a dream realm. While being perfectly tuned into consensual reality feels clearer, one could argue that it's ignorant if one doesn't know of any other possible tuning. That kind of clarity is delusion. Being partly tuned into something else can feel very hazy, but at least there is knowing of more than one channel being there. That knowing also makes it easier to let go of the suffering, and so, as if by magic, suddenly both the fog and the pain are gone. My visitor was very surprised by that sudden change.",

        "msg": "Second round of Adi's practice 2 for balancing attention and awareness ( https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/ekrscz/samatha_practices_to_balance_attention_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share ), 30 minutes reclining, followed directly by 15 minutes of focusing broadly on the breath, also reclining. I really don't like this exercise, which is probably pretty much exactly why I need it, so I'll keep doing it anyway. Intentionally steering around the attention is a drag, and there seems to be a glitch between doing that and having the chosen area come alive feeling itself. It seems like two different gears that don't know how to work together. Yet. So I get dull and forgot what I'm doing, or forget where I'm at in the sequence. I start the sequence over, again and again, and it gets less dull for a while, and then I forget again. I bring back the focus again, rinsing and repeating. At least this time I got to working on the awareness part, just a little bit. I started with adding the breath to all the touch points, and after a while I broadened it to more of the touch sense. That was complex enough for this time. I was doing the practice with somewhat fewer touch points this time to make it simpler. I think that next time I'll choose even fewer touch points to start with, and continue with that until the whole exercise works well enough, and then after that I can add some more touch points. I wonder how few touch points I might need to work with in order to go through with the entire exercise without losing focus. I suspect that I'll have to build it up very gradually. Perhaps I'll try just two or three touch points and stay with that 10 times before moving on to increasing the complexity. After that practice was done, I was eager to jot down some notes, and discursive thinking started spinning. Since this is a tendency that I know holds me back, I delayed acting on it by focusing broadly on the breath. Both restlessness and dullness showed up, but I knew that it wouldn't kill me to wait for 15 minutes, and since I wasn't going to give in to the impulse to write, I might as well just enjoy the breath for a while. And part of the time, I really did. There was bliss. No coarse piti. Contextual data: still waiting for delivery of tulsi tea, so somewhat foggy. I haven't done any yoga today yet (will do, now). I had only taken one ADHD pill, and too late (took the second pill just now). I had stayed up too late, and yesterday I had both starch and dairy. I have missed a deadline for a writing project, again, so I'm stressed about that. Not beating myself up, though. At least not actively fuelling it. I have eaten a fresh cooked artichoke, which is healing food, so that's helpful, and had sage tea. I have also had too much sweet fruit (dates and frozen cherries), which probably wasn't a great idea (especially not the dates; I get a jhanic taste from the cold sensations on my lips from the cherries, so they don't seem to hinder me quite as much). I haven't been outside in my garden, because I just got back a missing cat, and I want to keep him inside for a while now, so I need to keep the door closed. Not Morpheus this time, but Ezekiel. He didn't like it that Morpheus came back, after he had gotten used to having more space, so he started to stay away from home. And when he stays away from home, he eats more mice and gets worms, and that makes him want even more space (he has both downward spirals and upward spirals as well). So now I'm deworming him and spoiling him with cuddling, the latter of which is great for both of us. However, my body needs the daylight, especially in the morning, so conditions aren't optimal. Of course, they never are. Can't just hang around waiting for that to happen.",

Until I found myself all confused and tired, and then I realized that I had forgotten to eat and take my medz. So then I did that, and with some yoga, and then meditation got better. I went outside to meditate and listen to Michael's dharma talk. In my meditation I used a mantra (Om namah Shivay; it's not like there's a solid Buddha entity that's gonna be jealous anyway) and tuned into how it was doing itself and how even the subtlest subvocalization is doing itself and how tiny sparkles of attention activate sensations (those champagne bubbles) on the lips for sounds where the lips would touch, but how there is no need to identify with the doing of it. Then I had my interview with Michael and got some well needed advice on a small fork in the road. Then I did some chanting and devotional dancing out there on that little hill, and accidently scared someone away. So that's how you get to stay undisturbed in your meditation outdoors?

Nimitta embryo, some spaciousness but with an A&P touch to it. Lots of joy, both bodily joy and mental joy, not that I find them that separate when they aren't constructed as such. Before I got to this peaceful place with these amazingingly satvic friends, I did a lot of trigger practice, as the universe provided the opportunities. I usually don't write much about that, for integrity reasons and out of respect for all the people involved. It can be very educational to stay mindful about the contractions that arise and the expansions that come with more equanimous approaches. I have eased off from that for now, though, as the universe now provides opportunities for more of the tuning into peace. I prefer to go with the flow rather than intentionally seeking out stuff. When I go with the flow, enough challenges appear perfectly well on their own, as do the opportunities for just soaking in peace. I guess one could say that I'm sort of an opportunistic tantrika. I find that embracing the opportunities for trigger practice as they appear, rather than shoving them away, teaches something profound about the human experience that opens up to more compassion than would be accessible for me without it. This includes self-compassion but isn't restricted to that. It also teaches something about not self, and suffering of course, as it makes the chains of dependent origination stand out clearly. I bow to the awakened empty aliveness. May it work through me and use me as its tool and vessel so that I may embody and manifest as the union of wisdom and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings, without turning it into an identity to cling to.",

I felt like I was about to implode or blow up and like I was in a war zone. It turns out that I have an energetic life line. Me and this other person have been experimenting a bit with energetic entanglement (with caveats about how it's for the purpose of embodying the union of wisdom and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings). It turns out that it's actually possible to experience calm and blissful energy being sent from a distance, and that it (subjectively) works instantly before even having the information that it's being sent. There was a sudden and tangible shift from empathic PTSD to empathic jhanic qualities. I'm not gonna complain. I had asked for it while I was still working but thought it would happen later in the evening, because I thought it would require live interaction, but when the shift happened, I checked to see if there was any reply, and saw that energy had already been sent just a moment ago. Since the jhanic qualities are still there three hours later (with some refilling), I'll make use of them in meditation before I go to sleep. I feel very peaceful.",

Related to that I have triggers about how human interaction so often condemns people on the autism spectrum by assuming the worst. It's not fear specifically related to the awakening process, though. Or are we talking about different passages? It's life related fear, and that's something I need to work on in the process. Also, fear is far from the only trigger leading to contraction.

I could feel energy flowing through where there had been minor blockages. Thoughts and emotions and energetic tentacles were sorting themselves out, disentangling. Jhanic factors were present, tangibly so, but full absorption never occurred. After the session the color had returned to my cheeks and I both looked and felt healthier. Before that session I had been nauseaus from having to deal with an intense crisis for hours without having eaten properly, and with motion sickness added to that afterwards. I know from experience that such nausea can be a great doorway to great meditation. I recognized that the energy in it was basically the same energy as in jhana, just experienced through very different lenses.

Yet another pointer that the universe keeps sending my way from different directions is Abhinava Gupta\u2019s esthetical theory on emotional states that have the potential of cracking you open into something beyond the human emotion, something more detached and transcendent - rasa. It fits with where my practice is going right now. That's a central part of what I have been referring to as my trigger practice. When strong emotional states transmutate beyond the contraction, \"one taste\" becomes available, although it's not all the same but a beautifully nuanced rainbow of tastes that are all beautiful as they are. For the formal sit within the class, I applied tech from classical tantra, visualizing prana move back and forth between crown and heart as I focused on the breath, until it emptied itself out. Then sleep. When I woke up again, later in the morning, I fasted and drank tulsi tea and practiced: 20 minutes yoga to warm up the body pranayama - kapalabhati, deep cleansing breaths (\"candle blowing\"), nadi shodana Om japa in the chakras - I could feel the Om vibrate in each chakra 30 minutes of fire kasina in a dark room - not very impressive visuals, but felt purifying",

Yesterday I found out that someone who has become very important to me has had the same crazy \"download\" from fruitions in a review phase: a complex 3D model based on six different kinds of fruition doors and how they relate to the three characteristics and paradoxes around them in a way that shows that there are actually an infinite number of positions with regard to the different axes that can lead to fruition. We both based that on our own fruitions and saw a way to extrapolate it to other combinations, all in an energetic frenzy. Also, we both published it online and had people think we were batshit crazy for it. What are the odds? (Well not for people thinking it was crazy - that part was predictable - but the rest!). I'm going to look it up in my old logs and he is going to look for his old files, and then we'll compare notes. We both think it sounds like we are talking about the exact same thing. So either we are not only equally crazy but also crazy in the same way, or there is something to it.

Otherwise it would have freaked me out badly. In the beginning, the fear \u00f1ana was incapacitating. Meditating was the only thing I was able to do. As long as I surrendered to just being with it, it was fine, but if I tried to do something else, I felt like I was going crazy. So I surrendered, doing reclining meditation for two hours, just softening into experience. Misery and disgust followed. The vibrations were strong and the nada sound was roaring. It felt like riding out a hurricane. I just lay in my bed, with a cat next to me, letting the chaotic vibrations massage me while being with it, but I could at least text, and so I did, with someone who's familiar with the territory and could relate. It felt like if I were to stand up, the hurricane would blow me away. I laughed a bit at the silliness of that. As desire for deliverance set in, I cooked a meal, because I knew I had a small break during which I could do something constructive. I also had some cheese, because even though it makes me sleepy and gives me a headache, it's also very grounding. Reobservation didn't really freak me out, because having lived several decades with unmedicated ADHD, it feels a bit like home. There was a short grace of spacious calm before it all started over again. The second round of fear was more detached. I could feel the energy in it and for a while it was like I was floating on it. Very freeing! As it set in harder, I did some more yoga (I had already done yoga earlier), specifically addressing panic. It burned away some of the excess energy of it. Then I did 20 minutes of fire kasina while shifting into misery. I was surprised that the after image was so bright. I would have suspected it to go black. I didn't just see the red dot and versions of it, but also a real-looking flame. Weirdly enough, it wasn't in the same place as the dot, but above it. Then I was cold and tired so I lay down in bed and continued to watch the imagery untilI I fell asleep and slept for a couple of hours or so, zonked by the cheese. I woke up feeling more stable.",

Sometimes I could see a part of the image. Now I understand what Daniel means by third screen being spotted through a crack in the second screen, or however he phrased it. It really looked like there was a photorealistic image behind the murk, only partly visible through a hole/rip/tear. --- Early evening: Was trying to watch StarTrek but jhana wanted to happen so I shut it off, set the timer for half an hour, reclined and closed my eyes. I was drawn in gradually, weirdly enough with my body first while my thoughts and emotions weren't quite on board (I was pissed off because a friend insisted on doing dharma poking instead of... well, being a friend). Eventually thoughts and emotions were dropped (no thanks to the poking but in spite of it) and I was submerged in a relatively smooth first jhana.

My body said no to the conditions for the whole thing. There is only so much you can do when someone is self-sabotaging in spite of the very real and desperate needs, and I can't get drawn into playing out someone's else's drama and getting mindfucked for not doing what is impossible. I don't know whether or not that Aum Japa made a difference, but I managed to let go. It took a while longer for my body, but so far I have been able to detain both foods and liquid today. Gotta listen to the body. The standing practice today was... something else. Definitely A&P. There was cycling going on at a fractal level, which I could sense at the vibrational level, but A&P was predominant throughout the session. 25 minutes of wu chi, 17 minutes of balloon posture. There were these incredible waves of euphoria building up together with strong piti, sometimes resulting in a climactic energy wave with champagne bubbles bursting all over the place, often centered in the heart. Other times I could feel a craving for that to happen, and seeing the craving, the hook in it dissolved. Then there were lightness and bliss. I went through several cycles of this. The energy of the piti was so strong that my body would shake a bit. It was quite invigorating. 45 minutes of fire kasina. The learning sign was shining very brightly at times, and at other times less so. Sitting was comfy and easy. Time flied. I recalled a dream from the night, and realized that I have forgotten to log when this happens. It seems to be a pattern for the dreams to come up during meditation. In this dream I gave birth to a baby boy through my chest. Without my having anything to say about it, the baby was given the name Nivet. I didn't even know that it exists as a name, but apparently it does, and its meaning has to do with feeling extremely deeply and being very sensitive and intuitive. In the dream I was protesting against the naming but then realized that in focusing on that, I had neglected to nurture the baby which I was holding to my heart. He had gone blueish and lifeless. I shifted my focus to him, massaged his little chest to get his heart pumping, and soon he was alive and well. I breastfed him and was surprised to notice that the milk was already flowing in abundance.",

Early morning lucid dreaming: was in a beautiful environment when I suddenly realized that it was mindmade and that I was dreaming. I explored it and was amazed by how tangible and vivid the sensory impressions were. I could read signs on the buildings and study details of the architectury both visually and with touch. I started to open doors to see what was behind. I made the mistake of assuming that I wouldn\u2019t need to feel shame or guilt for opening doors since it was just a dream anyway, but that\u2019s not how it works. I broke the rules of the dream. Those were private doors, and in the dream there were consequences, so that took away the lucidity. The rest of the morning until noon sliding back and forth between awakeness and phase and occasional sleep. Lots of screen 2 and screen 3 phenomenology. Also vibrations and nada sound. Tried a bunch of techniques for leaving the body. Several impulses of actually leaving it, but the physical body reacted with jerky movements to resist it. Screen 2: structures in the black and grey. I could see that the grey was really made up of tiny colored dots. Pixelated. Screen 3: often preceded by everything turning white. Then either like screen shots or videos playing out. Text, like on a message board. Mainly regular text, but occasionally unknown symbols. Too quick flashes to read. Video of someone\u2019s living room, with people moving around in it, like captured on a screen with frames around it so the range was limited.",

        "msg": "I had trouble sleeping so I listened to this, using earphones: https://youtu.be/sm4fL_ANK6o . On the threshold between sleep and wakefulness I meditated and got into jhana, first and second. It started with the murk brighting up, sometimes with rainbow-like shimmerings in it, sometimes just white light. In first jhana I felt incredibly light. In second jhana there were visuals. I could see the test screen for Swedish television that would be displayed inbetween TV programs when I was a kid, in bright colors. There was also a countdown on a black and white screen. There was a scene showing a couple with a baby. For a while there was static, like it used to be in jhana earlier in my practice, together with strong gross vibrations. I'd say that was in a phase of descending back to first jhana again. Then the dots in the static clustered together to form intricate patterns, and I was back in second jhana with less gross vibrations. Around here I fell asleep and dreamed a non-lucid dream in which I was meditating and was still in an altered state in the dream. Then I found that the jhana juice was running out and I decided that it was time to log it, before deep sleep would lead to forgetting, so I woke myself up, which indicates that even though the dream itself was non-lucid, there was still - on some level - awareness that I was dreaming.",

        "msg": "Log Nov 12th 2022 Half an hour of yoga outside in the sunlight A few minutes of chanting and spontaneous movement practice Standing wu chi 25 minutes Balloon posture 18 minutes Fire kasina 45 minutes An hour or so of spontaneous movement practice in water The balloon posture was less challenging today. The fire kasina practice is starting to color other practices as well. I noticed today that I get photorealistic image flashes when I close my eyes, not only of the flame but also of the image I\u2019m standing in front of in the standing practice on a daily basis, which happens to be the live video screen of a person. It\u2019s fascinating how there is no qualitative difference between mental images and seeing something in the \u201dexternal\u201d world. Making the mental image project \u201doutward\u201d as something one actually sees, albeit not really with the eyes, is a very gradual process of very small changes in the processing. It seems to be the same process as going from the brain interpreting that maybe one heard the phone ring in the midst of noice from the vacuum cleaner to hearing the exact mobile phone signal as clearly as if it was ringing even though one holds the phone and can see that it\u2019s dead. I have gone through that process a few times; apparently it\u2019s a rather common stress induced hallucination among us autistic people. So - kasina practice is a way to develop convincing visual hallucinations. And now I\u2019m not only in the process of developing flame hallucinations, but also practice partner hallucinations, lol. Oh well, I can live with that. Getting to see this gradual development also makes it very clear how much our entire reality as we know it is basically a hallucination too. I\u2019m not saying that it isn\u2019t real, though. It\u2019s as real as it gets. After 43 minutes of Sam kasina - lol - the fire kasina was a piece of cake. The photorealistic image was bright, vivid and more longlived. I still had to blink a lot, as the refreshing cycles are still quite brief, but the refreshing time was only a fraction of a second whereas the visualization was a few seconds, so the ratio is slowly changing. Sometimes the brightness of the projected image increased into an enticing nimitta, but of course it was far too unstable for any real absorption to happen.",

At one point I saw microsleep coming and saw reality come back. It wasn't a cessation, because I was way too dull for that. There was a strange noice falling into sleep and the same noice again waking up, and when I fell asleep everything went black. I was quite surprised that it was that abrupt and that I could see both the falling asleep and the waking up so clearly. Despite my sleepiness and dullness, the learning sign kept appearing, albeit sometimes less vivid. practice discussion in Adi's discourse group a small amount of yoga Tried the DMT music recording again, and this time nothing happened, except the weird thing with noice while falling sleep and waking up happened again, and I found myself gasping for air as if I hadn't been breathing. Today: Cycling the dukkha \u00f1anas. Woke up in a very low mood. Spent a long time on the threshold between wakefulness and sleep, watching movements in the \"molten gold\" in the murk. Wu chi 25 minutes Balloon posture 18 minutes - challenging The standing practice started to pop up my sinuses with that ticking noice and opening up my stuffed nose. I could feel lots of smooth piti, but the mental joy lagged behind. Fire kasina 45 minutes (with a brief disruption from the caretaker of the house in which I rent my apartment). Vivid and bright photorealistic image of the flame. The practice improved my mood and made breathing easy. I was still rather low afterwards, but not as much. While I was at work (evening shift), spaciousness developed and equanimity developed. Have been listening to teachings on OBE:s and intend to do some exercises when I go to bed, after doing some yoga.",

        "msg": "Log Friday November 25th, 2022 During the Friday a week ago (Nov 18th) I did the usual shared practice routine with standing practice and fire kasina, a routine that I look forward to getting back into. During the weekend I was otherwise occupied with different workshops at a conference for polyamorous people, so I missed out on it. I had planned to sit anyway, at some other time, but instead I went with the flow of the event, which was extremely energetic and involved lots of mindfulness and lots of uncovering of sankaras. I did lots of spontaneous movement practice, as we had workshops on dancing with blindfolds and drama exercises and voice exploring exercises. They involved both introspective and interactive elements. I also did some yoga asanas now and then, but not in any disciplined way. Dropping into versions of awake awareness felt easy at the time, but I\u2019m now suffering the consequences of dialing down on the yoga and the standing practice and the fire kasina. On the Monday (Nov 21st) I had a crisis to deal with. I may have missed out on practice entirely, I don\u2019t remember. On the Tuesday I did a shorter fire kasina sit and was relieved to find that the learning sign is still there. Or have I mixed up the days? Not sure. On the Wednesday we tried a new posture for the standing posture, so first 25 min wu chi and 10 minutes of the balloon posture, and then 5 minutes of a posture with the hands higher up. It felt good. I look forward to doing more of that. Then I did fire kasina, a somewhat shorter session than usually. One of the days, probably the Tuesday (?), I did Michael\u2019s latest guided meditation from The Alembic. There were lots of light bursting out and sort of disentangling itself during the session. On the Thursday (yesterday, Nov 24th), I woke up with severe brain fog due to compromising with my body and eating stuff at work that I shouldn\u2019t have (social demands and yada yada). My meditation partner struggles with some health issues too, so we took it easy and skipped the standing practice as we were also short on time, but sat together until my housing support arrived. It was less than 40 minutes, but it felt awesome to sit through the brain fog like that. Today I again woke up with brain fog, and my body hurts. The last few days I have only done minimal amounts of yoga, some days not at all, so I need to get back on track with that. There have been lots of energetic stuff happening in daily life. During the conference there was mainly an A&P touch to it, with lots of light shows in color and soft warm silky energy around my body and a sense of everything being immersed in waves. Since then there have been more purification-like stuff. I can feel dukkha \u00f1ana vibrations as well as spaciousness opening up on a regular basis. Spanda.",

Yesterday: 15 min wu chi 15 min balloon posture 10 min third posture with arms above head slight in front of body and with hands turned forward, arms slightly curved, face slightly raised 1 h fire kasina later 45 min fire kasina a small amount of yoga Today so far: 15 min wu chi 15 min balloon posture 10 min third posture 50 min fire kasina I plan on doing some yoga and some more fire kasina before going to bed. The third posture opens up something new energetically, together with blood flow. I can feel it. I have come to realize that I'm burned out for real. It just doesn't feel the way it used to do before I was on the path - the burnout, I mean. This time it's obvious that there isn't any continuous self that is burned out. It's situated, contextual. Some specific patterned programming is broken. Very much so. Totally non-functional. Other patterns are less affected or unaffected, just subjected to the ordinary dukkha. And then there's a notable portion of unpatterened liveliness that is just fine! (I have great people in my life, including my boss and collegues, so I'll be fine - strategies are in place. I went through a trauma at my job and we are dealing with it.) In the fire kasina, the learning sign is getting somewhat more stable again, and it's getting brighter. Outside the sessions, I notice that there's often a delay before images in the visual field go away after I have closed my eyes when blinking. If I tune into this \"momentary visualization\" while walking, a nimitta embryo forms. It's hazy and probably somewhat bigger than a real nimitta, and with eyes open it's like a black nothing at the center of the image while it's relatively bright with eyes closed. The black version (eyes open) stands out more and earlier than the bright version (eyes closed). The visual image of the en environment that lingers when blinking is sometimes tangibly visible (often selectively), sometimes more like \"ordinary\" mental images and sometimes something inbetween. I have been noticing that sometimes in daily life it no longer feels like consciousness is located in my body. However, it doesn't feel like it's somewhere else either. It hasn't moved. It's more like the body feels like an avatar rather than a center. It is much more subtle than I have imagined this kind of experience to be. A while back I think I would have been very disappointed. Now... well, it is what it is. It's more like \"oh, okay\".",

        "msg": "I haven't prioritized logging recently, but I have been practicing. Fire kasina is still my main practice. I think I overdid the standing practice a bit, building up to four different standing postures. In combination with some food reactions, my shoulders got sore and I felt heavy, so I took a few days' break from that practice and did yoga instead, as I had been neglecting that. I need to have more movement than standing still, as it seems to balance things energetically. I got better, and now I'm back to doing the standing practice, albeit with a softer touch. Still doing shared practice over video. We have developed a little ritual of dedicating the practice to the benefit of all sentient beings with a verse that I came up with. I think I'm less burned out. It's going in the right direction. In a few days the light will start coming back as well. I have been noticing lately that I'm much less entangled in stories and that lots of situations have less of a hook in them. Sometimes it's a bit confusing. There used to be a sense of continuity that isn't really there anymore. My identity is falling through the cracks. Thoughts pop up that I don't know what to think about it, and then thoughts that I don't even know what would be there to have any opinions about it. And then I sort of shrug. It doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. There are aspects of my situation that can involve suffering if I let myself contract into that, like being far away from someone I love, but it also doesn't need to involve suffering. Contracting like that doesn't do any good. Why inflict a second arrow when I don't really need to? Other situations still occur where I do contract into suffering. Chapter 7 in the Recognition Sutras made me realize that the layer of the body that I tend to identify most with is the prana layer, so that's something I'll need to find a way to empty out. Michael Taft said that the energetic aspects have always been strong in my practice and that it can be a powerful way into liberation, but of course overidentifying with some layer would be a problem. It's funny how my weird food intolerances are exactly in line with what the Recognition Sutras say about the prana layer.",

I don't know whether it was a fluke or if it's something I can continue to tap into, but I'm thankful for the experience. It was a grace. Very subtle and yet powerful. Just the right amount of energy, nothing distracting. It made the learning sign somewhat more stable and took away the temptation of getting into a dull trance from watching the candle.

Copied from Adi's reddit text: Exercise 1.1 - Set up a gross grounding object Take your posture either seated or lying down on your back Your posture is decided by your physical constraints primarily and secondarily by temporary mental qualities - excessively dull - sit up straight, excessively energetic, restless - lie down Slowly parse through each sense door simply noticing that it exists. spend a couple of minutes on each sense door familiarizing yourself with the sense door and maybe tracking a couple of objects within that sense door. Take 4 to 5 slow deep abdominal breaths and make the outbreath long and thin. Piggy back on the relaxation of the diaphragm slowly relaxing all major muscles. Try to particularly relax your forehead, your eyelids, your jaws, your paws, your thighs. Typically our body has markers of 'doing'. Let go of the 'doing' in the body Place your attention on the aggregate sense of heaviness in the body Include the sense of temperature Include the sense of touch of wherever the body touches the chair or the floor The sense of heaviness, temperature and touch is now a gross / very large grounding object",

        "msg": "After digesting my dinner and doing 45 minutes of yoga (a challenging class), I went through the instructions for exercise 1.1 and spent 20 minutes doing them, sitting on my yoga mat without a cushion. This is a very fundamental exercise but I noticed how I have come to sort of take this kind of drill for granted and rush over it to get to the \"good stuff\", and how that completely misses the point. I set out doing this as if for the first time, making sure that I didn't skip any step and taking the time to really savour it. What a joy! I chose sitting on the yoga mat since I had just done a yoga class and gotten into a mode that was balancing relaxation with alertness, and staying on the yoga mat maintained that stance. See - a few seconds with eyes open but then light particles and shapes and swirlings and oscillations and so forth in the murk behind closed eyelids, with occasional mental images popping up very briefly. There is so much going on in the murk on a very subtle level. Hear - the amazing symphony of nada sound, the silence behind it, high frequency sounds from technical equipment, cats washing themselves, cars rolling by outside, occasional body sounds, sometimes interspersed with the mental sound of some mantra. When I tune into this, the world is a rich complex soundscape. Feel (touch) - the sweet touch of the air against my body, getting silkier as concentration grows; the energetic sensations of the breath in the entire body, the wawelike grosser physical sensations of the breathing which harmonize with the more delicate energetic sensations, and of course the touch of the ground, which is an intricate dance of sensations changing through the rhythm of the breath. There is so much to sense. Changing the flow of the outbreath ever so slightly - the tiniest little change - affects the whole body and the space around it. I can feel the spiralling little movements that the air makes on its way out through the nose, or on its way in through it. I can feel so many nuances of pressure changes in the nostrils and in the different sinuses, and how vibrations transplant themselves, and how that interacts with the how the movements of the belly also has energetic effects, and how the energetics have effects on the physical as well. It's like all the space is alive and aware, sensing, interacting internally. I can also feel the energetics of subtle thoughts popping up, and how they sort of bounce around. So that bouncing is actually still there - I just don't identify with it anymore. None of the points that pop up like that feels like me. Funny how the energetics of touch interacts with the nada sound and that complete silence that is also tangibly there to be heard at the same time (yes, I would say that the no-sound is there to be heard too, on a parallell channel), and with the subtle shifts of light particles in the murk. Smell - ah, hyacinths! The scent is there, not there, there, not there... It vibrates. It comes in and out of being so fast that it's amazing. It's all beyond control. Taste - so many nuances there can be to my own saliva. Not sure I have ever thought of that before. Constantly changing, and with gaps in it. It too vibrates. Mind - noticing the mind movements, how the mind reaches for a sensory impression and lets go of it, the vedana, subtle distinctions, subtle categories. Discursive thinking is minimal here but pops up occasionally to comment on the investigation. By the time I get to the deep abdominal breaths, I'm alredy deeply relaxed, but I go through the list to make sure I haven't missed any tensions. I'm already attuned to how the breathing soothes my bodymind. I feel like I'm floating. I allow myself to sink into the ground. I have no idea how anyone could not sense the temperature and how it oscillates around the body at this point. I feel very grounded but also uplifted.",

        "msg": "After doing another ten minutes of yoga, I sit again, moving to exercise 1.2 for 20 minutes. I can see why Adi talks about avoiding habituation by changing the instructions on a regular basis, because it wasn't quite as easy to approach all the sense gates with the same alert curiosity even the second time, although it was still quite the joy diving into them one at a time. I noticed similar aspects of them as in the first exercise, but there were a few times when I had to remind myself of which sense I was supposed to focus on because I was distracted by planning my logging. That's ADHD - the second time around the brain is already impatient, lol. Well, the practice was back on track pretty fast each time. I may have forgotten to separate out mind as a sense in its own right here, can't remember. I wouldn't exactly say that the sense of touch between two hands is subtle. There's plenty of touch to go around there. I wouldn't exactly say that it isn't dynamic either, as there are so many touch points between two hands and the sensations keep changing all the time. Of course, at times it synchs up in a way that makes it feel still and very holistic (taking away the sense of subject-object), but that's transient too. But yeah, it's not quite as grounding as tuning into everywhere my body touches the ground. Thoughts do pop up sometimes as if the brain thinks that it might as well keep itself occupied with other stuff since it isn't really doing anything important. That's something to work on. I think I'll work on this exercise until my brain is more pliant and settles with the object effortlessly, before moving on to the next exercise. However, I'll make a slight change: instead of placing one hand in the other, I'll place my hands on my knees, as I find that more comfortable.",

        "msg": "Morning chanting to Tara --- Shared practice: Standing practice combined with noting based on the sense modalities - Wu chi 15 min, balloon 10 min (we have found that's our sweetspot at the moment). I decided that it's better to keep my mind occupied with something predetermined instead of having it run amok planning the day, and I was reminded yesterday how much I enjoy just taking in the senses. I find it fascinating how fast this makes dualities collapse for me. I start out with sensory impressions coming in through one door at a time, from out there to in here, but very soon they synch up so that everything is here and aware. Like, when I hear a car rolling by outside, I am the car and I can literally feel the ground under my wheels while also feeling the air against my skin and see images, and it's all in one holistic package. This is the formations that appear in EQ, I'd say. Complete programming seqences that create the world as I know it. Sitting practice 45 min - for me fire kasina. The learning sign was generallt brighter, sharper and more longlasting. The cycling through the dukkha \u00f1anas was apparent, though, which affected the learning sign as well as the body. The first time fear showed up I reacted somewhat, wondering what was wrong for a few seconds, because I could see no reason whatsoever to feel fear. Then I realized that it was probably just the natural sequence for the mind after the dissolving of the learning sign in dissolution had reminded it of the lack of reability of everything, even though I know that by now, and so I didn't engage with it anymore. The cycling kept going on and on. All \u00f1anas weren't always clearly marked, but the overall development was very typical. On and on it went. No problem. The mind stayed alert and relatively focused as the sequences played out on their own. --- Yoga 20 min - heavenly --- Yoga 40 min, followed by Adi's exercise 1:2, sitting for 45 min. I thoroughly enjoyed both. My mind is super-greatful for the variation and for knowing exactly what it's supposed to focus on, and that makes it surprisingly pliant all of a sudden. I get into this spacious mode with that exquisitely pleasant taste to it, and I relish the texture of all sensations, including traffic noice. The vibrations of it are just beautiful. It was easy to remember the instructions that I had read again and gone through before the sit. There was plenty of smooth rich piti and plenty of sweet sukha. My hands immediately got warm and smoothly buzzing and felt large and heavy on my knees. There was brightness and loud nada sound and lots of very tangible silence and stillness. By the time I got to the part of focusing on my hands, the mind had already built up to that and welcomed it wholeheartedly. Strong focus was building up. However, as I got even more tranquil, dreamlike scenes popped up along with some memories. There were short instances of starting to forget what I was doing. I kept coming back to my hands, though. There were also instances of extremely strong silence popping up, shouting out everything else so that there were no perceptions and no thoughts going on. These silences are marked by a very tangible presence without there really being anything there to be present to. They are followed by a \"whoa!\" as the senses come back online again. I have had that happen a lot recently. All in all, it was a very pleasant sit. I feel rejuvinated and both relaxed and alert. The nada sound is loud. The exquisite texture to sensory experience remains and I feel like I could float away on them.",

        "msg": "I'm lagging behind with the logging. I have been practicing, but the quality has varied considerably. On the Wednesday, the day practice was delightful. I felt like I could have continued sitting for hours, and the learning sign was brighter and sharper and more longlasting, and the standing practice was a joy. Then I worked late and had some foods that didn't agree with my energy body, and I got really sluggish during the evening practice. I tried Adi's exercise 1.3, as quoted below: \"Exercise 1.3 - Set up a dynamic grounding object Do steps #1 to #4 from exercise 1.1 Choose 3 to 4 touch points - buttocks on the floor, ankles on the floor, touch of the lips, touch of the hands etc Cycle between the touch points in a set repetitive pattern. If too repetitive intentionally change the pattern. Add to this. Listen to 3 sounds, pay attention to 3 thoughts, come back to your touch point pattern - rinse, repeat This planned, deliberate, intentionally chosen movement of attention is your dynamic grounding object\" It didn't go very well, as I could barely stay awake, let alone remember the instructions. I was sleep deprived together with the food reaction. It seems that I regularly misjudge what I can eat so that I trigger dissolution. Since then it has gone up and down. I have done standing practice, fire kasina and one of Adi's exercises each ari except Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (Sunday and Saturday) during which I only did Adi's exercises combined with my old practice of looking at the ground with a relaxed gaze while waiting for the train, letting the ground dissolve into waves. I did Adi's exercises while on the train, with fine clarity and focus. I have varied between exercises 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. I find that it seems to work best for me when I let the grounding object self-select. Apparently, the lips make up a great one. As for 1.3, the different touch points want to present themselves rather than adhering to a specific order. I don't know if adjusting the instructions like that robs the exercises of some central aspect. It did make the sitting almost jhanic, which was a welcome change after so much dullness. I have squeezed in as much yoga as I have managed, together with some spontaneity movement practice. Since I was so fatigued around Christmas, I think I'd better add a week to the first two week slot in the instructions I got from Adi.",

Then yoga nidra. Pod meeting (RtS). More gentle yoga. Then 30 min exercise 1.3, modified to letting the focus points self-select. The first points to self-select were lips, nose-tip, hands to kness/thighs and touch points to the ground. Soon the fingers touching were added (gian mudra), and the sense of the breathe at the tip of the nose started to migrate. It moved to inside the nose very briefly and then to sinues around and behind the nose and then to behind the forehead, mainly third eye. The vibrations were strong there and correlated with flourescent light swirls. Sometimes it was more in the eyebrow region, and sometimes at the top of the head, in the scalp. It went back and forth between third eye and top of head for quite some time. Then there was a figure-ground shift where the body moved into the background and emphasis was on spacious awareness without center. There was also a shift from movement to stillness.",

        "msg": "Thankyou Aviva! Reading your comments was helpful. I'm glad that it can be encouraging for someone else and grateful for the reminder that it is progress even though it doesn't necessarily feel like it. You are right, it is. Yes, I do struggle sometimes. Regularly. It varies considerably. A lot of work remains. I once heard Adyashanti say that the first awakening (or something like that, which I interpreted as stream entry) is a grace that is bestowed upon us without us having to deserve it, and after that we need to do the work to deserve it. What I find uplifting about that is that it means that struggling after stream entry is normal, so it doesn't mean that I somehow lost it. And yes, I have energy body issues. I have eaten what most people would probably consider very healthy foods during Christmas, but it still wasn't good enough for my energy body. It contained some dairy and dried fruits and potatoes and some pickled herring. I even ate some mints and a small amount of chocolate. It really isn't worth it. I had to pay for that for several days with sluggishness and body pain. But I feel better today! What a grace! (Haha, I'm predictable - my ipad suggested the word grace and then the word predictable, lol). Yoga is a life saver. It makes such a huge difference for me. Right now I mainly do videos from Livinleggings, BrettLarkinYoga and Yoga with Kassandra on youtube. Yoginimelbourne is another favorite. I miss my yoga studio, though. Working with live teachers is awesome.",

        "msg": "Woke up early, not in pain and not exhausted. Got some work done, took a quick yoga break and then worked some more. Then I did 30 min of yoga followed by fire kasina for 30 minutes with decent focus. Later I did the shared practice, 15 min wu chi, 10 min balloon posture and 45 min fire kasina. The video screen turned into a kasina already during the standing, with photorealistic images of my partner popping up in the murk together with loud high-frequency nada sound and my sinuses gradually opening up with a rhythmical ticking sound. In the fire kasina the learning sign was bright and clear and more longlasting than average. It varied with the cycling, though. Towards the end of the sit there was some dullness. At first I played with investigating to what extent the dullness was some kind of aversion that could be relaxed. The first couple of times that subtle dullness appeared, that investigation was enough to spike curiosity that took away the dullness. Later the dullness became somewhat more persistent. I managed to maintain mindfulness except for a brief moment when I forgot not only what I was doing but also who I was, to the extent that I was caught up in some totally fictive problem that could have been a snippet from somebody else's life. Like a dream scene or a scene in a movie. It wasn't my life but I was in the midst of it. I snapped out of that very quickly, and even though the scene was as vivid as my daily life while it played out, I think, I soon couldn't remember it. Now, obviously that was gross dullness, as it made me completely forget that I was meditating, but I also cannot but wonder if that sort of thing is actually a real scene in someone's life. Maybe we have access to that when we get out of our own sense of being centered in this mindstream, but forget about it when we get back to our usual mindstream, who knows? I really have no way of telling. Regardless, I'll keep working towards more mindfulness. If that means that I'll stop dipping into scenes like that, that's fine, and if it means that it will still happen but with maintained mindfulness, that's fine too. Honestly, I think I would prefer the latter.",

Then I did the exercise, sitting for 45 min. I enjoy starting with one sense modality at a time, waking them up. I notice how it gets the alfa waves going, as flourescent swirls come up. I tend to loose momentum a bit in the part with relaxing breaths, maybe because I have already been doing that while focusing on the senses, so suddenly there is less for the mind to occupy itself with. Reading through the instructions I realized that what I have thought of as the sense modality mind is what this exercise is about, so I have already been practicing that. However, I had let it self-select. Now I was to be in control of the directions it was to take. You know that exercise that kids get taught in order to fall asleep, counting sheep? For me black sheep would always pop up, refusing to jump over that gate. I had a similar feeling now. There was a delay in its response, until I found a way to tune into how the awareness was already alternating between those different locations and scopes. Then suddenly it was super-fast. Maybe that's cheating? Towards the end of the sit, there was a sense of awareness falling in on itself and becoming super aware, with a huge crescendo of the nada sound, then a fraction of a moment in complete silence, and then roaring nada sound again.",

        "msg": "Started and ended the day with yoga. Nothing advanced or sweaty. Energizing stuff in the morning, short and sweet. Grounding slow explorative stuff in the evening, spanda inspired, for a longer time but with low intensity. My pawo got up at 4 am, in spite of not getting much sleep, so that we could practice together before my housing support, so that was luxurious. 15 min of wu chi and 45 minutes of fire kasina, with a couple of brief interruptions from job phone calls. I was fascinated by how the image of the flame stays for a while when I close my eyes. It's like a cache memory thing, with the visual input in storage so that it's still accessible even though the vision is offline. After the housing support, reclining entangling wanted to happen, so I just lay down and let it happen. It went on for at least an hour without me doing anything. There was a sense of mild absorption and releases happening as those energetic tentacles did their disentangling. I had planned to do more work after that and to also do more structured meditation, but I fell asleep afterwards and slept for a few hours. Then I listened to a couple of RtS class recordings, partly while doing my yoga thing. I'm struggling a bit with the darkness, the literal darkness, that is, the lack of sunshine. The sun is so low here in Scandinavia at this time of the year. At least today I got some sunlight. My drive to do anything is pretty low too, just like the sun. I sort of feel like hibernation wouldn't be such a bad idea. There are persistent ideas coming up that it \"shouldn't\" be this heavy, and of course that doesn't help at all. Trying to find that narrow little sweetspot of accepting the feeling while still not indulging in it. It's fuckin' hard! I still too often get stuck in trying to avoid it. At least now I can see that, which means that there's an option of not actively avoiding it.",

        "msg": "I get it now. Haha! I realize now exactly what exercise 1.3 good for. And it\u2019s not about attention, really, but learning how to apply awareness to something more focused. That\u2019s exactly what I need both in order to move forward with my fire kasina and to approach daily life challenges with less suffering. I don\u2019t have to get into a super-dualistic attention mode in order to be focused on one thing. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It actually just took a few seconds of unshattered focus in the fire kasina to grok these pointers, much thanks to conversations with dharma friends. That says a lot about how shattered it has been lately, that I couldn\u2019t see that before. Haha! I mean, of course the learning sign bounces when I put most of the juice into attention mode in looking at the flame. Attention flickers back and forth between left and right eye in order to create a 3D image, which means that I actually see the flame from two different angles which positions it differently in space. That bouncing image is what attention sees. Attention can never be stabilized. But awareness can. This is also why I have encountered some dullness lately in the fire kasina. Attention mode is exhausting. So I need to get out of having attention mode be the default approach to anything with a narrow focus. I bet that if I read Adi\u2019s instructions for what to change in my fire kasina practice for the next time slot, those instructions point to this. I haven\u2019t read them yet, because I knew myself well enough not to. I need to grok things empirically - and I need to stay in the moment rather than trying to plan ahead. A few seconds of fresh curious looking at the flame enabled me to go from \u201dit still bounces around and it shouldn\u2019t\u201d to \u201dhmmmm, fascinating that the image so consistently bounces between left and right like that - I wonder why that is\u2026 oh, that\u2019s right, I actually have two eyes\u2026 oh, of course! The cache memory is a biofeedbach mechanism! This is just a slow motion replay of the focus I just had!\u201d So - I was focusing on what was arising rather than being what knows the arising. Can\u2019t fool that biofeedback. The bouncing is not some random bug. Of course, this means that I actually do need to train that skill. There\u2019s no way around it. That\u2019s the \u201ddownside\u201d. But on the upside, it\u2019s not attention that I need to train, so attention deficit won\u2019t be a problem in the long run. --- That's the report for the 45 min fire kasina. Before that, we did the standing practice, 15 + 10 min. In wu chi, the muscles in the arches of my feet cramped a bit because they did what they are supposed to do, which they still aren't quite used to. After some flowy movements in between the postures, they felt much better. It also felt like the balloon posture somehow balanced the energies in a way that made that part easier. Later today I have so far done one 10 min session of exercising the flexibility of awareness. Just 10 minutes, and then I was exhausted! Not too exhausted, though. I have actually felt great since then. It was a time span that made it possible for me to avoid spacing out in spite of the effort it took to go against habit. Then I had a pod meeting for the RtS class, which was inspiring. Moodwise this has been a great day, but I have procrastinated work stuff. I sincerely hope that I'll be able to break that pattern tomorrow. I also haven't been outside in daylight or done my yi rang (slept late because of the RtS class). Time for yoga! At least I'll do that. And then give the awareness flexibility exercise another go.",

When I started practicing, my visual thinking wasn\u2019t online, so it was easy to feel the body \u201dfrom inside\u201d as the default. With continuing practice, my ability to visualize developed, which is great for many reasons, but it started to get in the way of more direct experience. So in a way, my development has been a bit backwards. I guess it\u2019s time to integrate that. Now (during this particular walk) I have like two modes that I go back and forth between. In one mode, steering the awareness of body sensations (moving it and changing the scope) is instant, and it's like awareness simply moves into that part, experiencing reality from there. In the other mode, which happens when I try to think about what I'm doing, I slip back into imagining the body from the perspective of seeing it. The latter feels more dualistic and gives a sense of separation, and there is negative vedana from that.",

Towards the end, there was some pain in my right should that popped up and went away with a cracking. I think an energy block was partly dissolved. That shoulder has troubled me for quite some time to a varying degree, and now it feels better. Fire kasina 20 min (we were short on time before my housing support was to arrive) - wow!

It still flickered, though, and faded so that I had to refresh it. Lots of sukha. Effortless. No dullness. None of that heavy sleepiness that it has induced lately, and it even felt very strange to think that dullness could occur from it. It was so relaxed and free from strain, and so far from boring. Good focus. For a brief while, thoughts popped up that represented views related to the dharma, comparisons between practicioners, but in the midst of it, it sort of dawned on me exactly how empty those thoughts were and that in fact I don't know. I really don't. And I don't need to know. Sounds trivial but felt incredibly freeing and joyful. I repeated the thought \" I don't know \" several times and I was so happy! There was a sense of sacredness when I thought about all those other practicioners, all being on the path, all exactly where they are which is unknown to me, so beautiful, Have continued to check in with awake awareness while going about my daily business, and continued to practice flexibility of its scope. I feel equanimous and spacious and alive and so fuckin' grateful. Being less contracted is such a grace. I haven't had any issues with procrastinating today.

The learning sign wasn\u2019t bouncing around much, and yet it was fairly bright. 50 min yoga outside in the daylight. Challenging, as my muscles were already sore. Could see a nimitta embryo during the practice. Got into mild absorption during the shavasana afterwards. 45 min reclining meditation, Adi\u2019s instructions for Vipashyana For the entire text, see https://www.reddit.com/r/Arhatship/comments/tuc8ij/vipashyana_geared_towards_the_quality_of_anatma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button This is actually something that I\u2019m very familiar with, by accident. For one thing, this is what tended to happen earlier in my practice when I tried to do shamatha with an object and found that the object requires effort and I wasn\u2019t motivated enough to make the effort because it felt so good just resting like this (this is how I found my way into the disentangling practice). Second, it\u2019s something I have done with the RtS class a lot. Michael often says \u201dNow let go of that\u201d, or talks about dropping the ball, but I prefer the very precise phrasing here, to withdraw the energy needed for maintaining the object. Michael describes it like that when he explains what letting go or dropping the ball means, so it\u2019s the same thing. So yeah, I know how to do this. I do it regularly, as a doorway into the disentangling. This is one of my favorite practices. As grounding object I chose the sense of spaciousness in my sinuses, as that self-selected (as it often does). Having done the exercises leading up to this exercise was helpful for increasing the clarity that can otherwise vary lot. So from now on, if I find that the disentangling doesn\u2019t seem to want to do itself, now I know how to build up to it in a more systematic way. Loud nada sound coming out of the meditation. Shared practice: - Warming up mpvements - Wu chi 15 min. My sinuses opened up with a rhythmic ticking (sounding like a clock). Some minor adjustments of my posture was needed as I sometimes got out of the balance, mainly tilting the pelvis too much in one direction. - Warming up movements - Fire kasina 22 min. Lots of sukha. Had to stop a catfight somewhere in the middle of it; sang Om Mani Padme Hung, and as usual that made the attacking cat stop and go outside to burn some excess energy instead - I\u2019m fascinated that it works so consistently well. - Warming up movements - Balloon posture 10 min. First there was a phase with clear 3rd jhana qualities bit without the kind of absorption that would make it fit my criteria of jhana. After that, there were som distracting thoughts (planning). At the end, there was some negative vedana due to pain in the shoulders. As I noted that as vedana, the pain turned into piti. Piti also appeared as a warm fluffy buzzing in my hands. - Fire kasina 20 min. The breath was very subtle. The word \u201dethereal\u201d popped up as a description of how the practice (or the world for that matter) felt. There were instances of tingling in my scalp.",

        "msg": "Log Wednesday Jan 11th, 2023, shared practice Wu chi 15 min: ticking of sinuses, images turning themselves into kasinas in the form of shortlasting photorealistic images when eyes close. Fire kasina 22 min: bouncing learning sign for a while, then more stable, then varying back and forth. Subtle sleepiness appeared but determination was enough to turn it into alertness, which came together with piti thanks to the unification of the mind. Balloon posture 5 min: lots of piti, kasinas self-selecting. Fire kasina 22 min: relatively little bouncing, sometimes with great clarity, sometimes with not so great clarity, and varying staibility. Thoughts came up adressing urgent tasks. I managed to let go of the thoughts for the purpose on focusing on the kasina --> piti. During the night between Wednesday and Thursday Meditated in my dreaming. It was jhanic. First psychedelic imagery appeared, shining through the murk - intricate swirling patterns in clear colors. Then I got into a hyper-3D starfield, black/white/greyscale, with extreme topography standing out. I was moving through it as if in warp speed. Log Thursday Jan 12th Wu chi 10 min: balanced, tranquil, kasinas self-selecting as a biproduct. Fire kasina 30 min: using the pointer of not focusing on what arises but being what knows the arising (Jigme Lingpa, Trackless Path, translation and commentary by Ken McLeod). Late night yoga 40 min: aiming at quieting the mind and calming down the nervous system - hypnagogic imagery without dullness. Log Friday 13th (oh, that explains a lot, lol) Morning: OBE exercises. I recognized the phase but didn't accomplish any tasks. Morning/noon: 50 min of yoga outside in the sunlight (my neighbors are used to me being weird by now so I have nothing to lose). Shared afternoon practice: Wu chi 15 min - nothing special to report. Sitting 25 min: Instead of doing the fire yoga, I did the exercises 2.1 - both of them, grounding in awareness as well as the continuation: It felt like free-falling. In the latter part I eventually allowed the different fields to merge into one energy field, as I withdrew the energy needed for keeping them distinct from each other (that is, maintaining that construct). Balloon posture 10 min: I felt the energy from the breath very tangibly. At the end, there was negative vedana from a shoulder hurting. Sitting 25 min: a bunch of exercises, starting with grounding in awareness and moving on to (or back to) setting up a dynamic grounding object (the breath reverberating in the sinuses, hands on knees, contact with the ground beneath me), then varying the scope of awareness (after completing the instructions I did the same thing for the right side of the body). In the two latter exercises I included one instance each of visiting all the other sense modalities. Then I did some choiceless awareness, which developed into the awareness turning back into itself. In both the sitting sessions, access to steering awareness happened instantly. Daily life Manged to challenge my difficulties with executive functioning in task (writing) associated with anxiety, thanks to mental support (it was a mutual thing, a win-win deal, as we both got more done than we would have alone). Today (Saturday Jan 14th), so far During the night lots of swirling imagery. Shared practice with Wu chi 15 min, 25 min of sitting (fire kasina), a break for hanging out and talking about the dharma, then another 25 min of sitting (fire kasina). The learning sign was relatively pliant without yet evolving. There were distracting thoughts coming up, with some reactivity, but it felt good to let go of them for the time being.",

Earlier in my practice I wouldn't have been able to stop engaging with the rambling. Now I kind of did. The thoughts kept happening and I didn't suppress them but I also didn't fuel them. I did cry at times, though. There were emotional responses to the thoughts. I let that play out and watched how the contraction around the thoughts led to suffering. I saw how little control there is and how futile it is, trying to be in control. I saw how I can't even control the urge of being in control, and how that made me feel helpless, or rather, how that made a me come into being that felt helpless. And in a weird way, that was okay. There were lots of negative vedana, but it was okay. Crying was okay. Not being in control was okay. Seeing that there is no way of being in control somehow felt comforting. I saw that there are selves coming into being that would rather be liked than awakened and I could feel compassion for that. Well, something did, anyway. There were a sense of peace at times. There were phases of more contraction too. The thought popped up that this is actually a great opportunity for practice, and I'm so fucking grateful for that thought popping up. Contraction keeps showing up in waves, even as I write this, and tears mess with the touch pad. Well, what do you do? I will try to approach this as an opportunity for practice rather than just feeling sorry for myself, and if that's all I get to do in the floating tank tomorrow, then at least I get to see the three C:s. There were energetic releases and a sense of freefalling during the wu chi, that ticking in the sinuses during the first fire kasina session, and in the ballon posture that thing happened again that happened the first time I tried the standing practice: it felt like it took away bodily defenses and I was left without that shield. There was a rush of fear coming up from that, but I didn't identify with it but instead thought it was interesting. I let the sense of being defenseless be there and be aware. In the second fire kasina session, most of the time I treated the flame more as an anchor that sort of felt safe and did less of the actual kasina thing. It took a while before I fully realized that, and then I made an effort to do the kasina thing. The learning sign pliantly showed up.",

Apparently bumpy ride tantrikas are a legit tradition. Michael Taft says so. We are the ones who contract ourselves like crazy because that forces us to see stuff. I feel like I'm a tiny little light-weight boat on a very stormy sea, but the little boat is surprisingly robust and has a very sturdy anchor under the surface, so although it looks like the boat is going to crack to pieces anytime or swept away God knows where, it actually miraculously keeps bouncing back against all odds. The floating was\u2026 different from what I expected. Surprisingly uncomfortable. I think I actually prefer floating in regular water. Such a silly thing, thinking that I would need to pay all that extra money to float when I float fine anyway. I sometimes even have a hard time not floating. Like, if I hug someone while being in water, I find myself floating up to the surface. Sensory deprivation, my ass. It smelled like an entire football team had been sweating in there, and actually they had. I think this was probably a low-budget tank. Extremely poor ventilation, not sound proof, not even light-proof. And I kept bumping into the walls. The floating did help with my nerve pain, though. And I felt like I was floating the rest of the day. Well, at times. I got a bit nauseaus too, because I was stupid enough to work more hours directly after that than I\u2019m assessed to be able to do (the idea that one needs to work the exact same amount of hours for five days per week is totally flawed, though). It would probably be better to rest afterwards. When I had time to rest, after work, I was super-tired and felt like I was floating and kept giggling. I looked like and sounded like how stoned people are portrayed in American TV-series (I have never been stoned so I can\u2019t compare). My muscles were super-relaxed the rest of the day. They still are even though I have been ridiculously stressed up by life stuff. I was afraid that I would get severe neck pain, because it turns out the head gets tilted backwards in a weird angle, but I didn\u2019t. It felt like I didn\u2019t relax at all as much as I would have wanted to do. It didn\u2019t at all feel like I got into any special state. Sure, there were light effects, but I get that everytime I\u2019m in darkness. Yet, I found that efterwards my brain had a hard time thinking for a while.

I won't log all my practice, as I find it too repetitive. I'm in Michael Taft's Reversing the Stack class, the first cohort, which has been going on since June 2020. The task is to spend as much time as possible in awake awareness while bringing the emptiness back into form. I practice sitting, standing, lying down and moving around, with varying success. An anchor in my practice is practicing together with one of my partners on a daily basis, alternating Zhan Zuang (still not sure how to spell it correctly, lol) with sitting. Another anchor is yoga, as my life tends to fall apart without it. Flowy spontaneous movement is a powerful doorway for me. I do fire kasina. Although I have gotten a lot out of Daniel's resources on the topic, I have chosen to follow Adi Vader's instructions insofar as I'm using the photographically realistic image of the flame (corresponding to third screen in Daniel's terminology) as the learning sign rather than the red dot. For me personally that feels like a more stable approach. Still in the process of cultivating the tranquil alertness that is needed, still in the process of learning how to let awareness take care of it rather than using the brute force of attention. A new development is related to posture. I recently spent two hours in a floating tank, which made me aware of how I have habituated ways of carrying my body that may not be optimal. In the floating tank, the neck position was not at all what I had thought it would be. I'm now experimenting with trying to replicate that in my standing and sitting practices, which also needs to adjustment of the upper back. It's outside my comfort zone, but it does something amazing with energy or blood flow or the circulation of neurotransmittors, or whatever. It suddenly feels like there is so much more oxygen in the air I breathe, and sluggishness dissipates.",

        "msg": "I had a semi-psychedelic experience from being sleep deprived today. On the threshold between sleep and wakefulness, reality was in a state somewhere between emptiness and form. It was all sort of a volotile fluid that was morphing. Here and there, on a regular basis, some of the shimmering rainbowy fluid would contract and assume some shape that almost came into being as something distinct, before it was reabsorbed into the whole. Earlier, before I went to sleep (late in the morning after having talked to a dharma friend for hours after the RtS class), I had three unknowing events where the magnificent silence fell onto me and merged with my entire existence. Sort of like a collapse into the void, or the void collapsing into me, or reality just turning inside out to reveal the void inside it. This happened in the midst of interaction with my pawo. Today with all the sleep deprivation, the standing practice felt very raw and defenseless. There was panic in my body, but I was okay with it. I remembered that this is what the practice is about, so I focused on cultivating crisp awareness of the sensations of it. The fire kasina following it turned out to be less fire kasina as those sensations continued to be in the foreground.",

Then let choiceless awareness happen. The energy field was alive and felt volatile, like I was dissolving into atoms. Concepts fell away. There were three distinct flashes, like in the impermanence door, but I didn't identify any cessation. Then there was a moment of either recalling one of the flashes as an image or having a new image appear for a brief while. It looked like a colored illustration from a children's book, featuring a penguin with a red bowtie. The environment was not snow and ice, but had more colors in it, maybe like a park with trees or something; I can't recall any specifics from it. Then there was a moment of \"Wtf, did I just see a penguin?\" and the recognition that I did in fact, but now there was murk there instead. --- 45 minutes of sitting with my pawo, doing fire kasina. The learning sign was rather fuzzy. I was tired. It was around midnight and my sleep hasn't been the best lately, so that was to be expected. I made it through the sit without spacing out or forgetting my focus. Some thoughts popped up during the sit, though, so I wasn't entirely undistracted.",

Applying the lessons from the floating tank makes it less strenous for the shoulders. Instead I use my back muscles between the shoulder blades more. That seems to open up for more of a free flow. In the fire kasina, the photographically realistic image projected onto the murk was brighter and sharper than has been the case the last few days. It also started out more bouncy. I relaxed into the knowing of the flame instead of letting myself bounce around with it, and after a while the bouncing decreased while maintaining brightness and clarity. There was high-pitched nada sound. Some time later, a black disc covered the image. Sometimes it would shine through it. It went back and forth like that for a while. Then brightness and clarity increased again. There was alertness and curiosity throughout the practice, along with a sense of effortless relaxing into it, except for a brief while when I tried to actively increase the brightness of the image. I noticed how that caused subtle agitation, and so I let go of it. I played with sort of knowing the brightness that was already there on its own, and that did boost the brightness just a little bit. Still not stable, though. It will get there.",

Getting the flame image to appear in the murk wasn't very easy, but I did appear at times. Also, there was a sense of a space in the mind where it would have been, so I focused on that.

        "msg": "I haven't reported in a while, but I have been practicing. In the fire kasina, I'm working on unhooking. A while back I received advice from Adi (slightly edited from interaction below). I know what the unhooking is. Funny thing is that I came up with almost the exact same practice for that during the summer of 2021, when the practice was going really well. I used it on earworms, which were usually but not always mantras, so it was longer chunks. I also played with hearing comments from different people including myself. I noticed how subvocalizing was always involved when I had the sense of being the doer of the mental sound. I played with relaxing that. And for a while that went really well. Right now I\u2019m in a phase when it\u2019s harder to relax the subvocalizing. However, I don\u2019t need to limit the experience to what goes on from that narrow perspective, because that\u2019s the infamous kazoo player from MCTB2, or the sock puppet, as Michael calls it. I don\u2019t need to get rid of the kazoo player/sock puppet, as I understand it. I can just zoom out from it. It\u2019s not the sock puppet that experiences it all. It just experiences itself, whereas the fuller symphony is also aware on its own. Applying this to vision seems in some ways easier and in some ways trickier. I can rather easily get the sense of the seeing occurring not inside my head but where the flame image is, which is in awareness, and awareness doesn\u2019t really make a difference between inside and outside my head. However, I still repeatedly fall into the trap of using attention to focus on the flame with my eyes open and then look for it in the murk in a way that objectifies it. I notice that because it makes the learning sign bounce and makes my eyes struggle with re-finding focus every time I open my eyes. And when that happens, the effort makes me tired. So I apply determination and curiosity to be more alert while also working on relaxing that focus by just letting the flame know where it is. And when that works, the flame image stays in the same space regardless of whether or not I have my eyes opened or closed. But it still fades.",

        "msg": "Another development is both positive and negative at the same time. I'm much less bothered by withdrawal symptoms from antidepressants as the symptoms tend to feel like energy flow instead of like wanting to crawl out of my skin. That's awesome in a way, but it also makes me forget to take my medz. That has happened many times lately, which is not good. I think it stresses out my mammalian body, because after like 12 hours, I'm in pretty strong withdrawal. It still feels like energy flow, but by then I notice that meditation doesn't calm it down, and instead it's getting somewhat agitated. And when I take the medicines, I notice the energy flow that results from that, and it disturbs my sleep. It doesn't feel bad per se, but it's an uneven flow, not a harmonious one. Being aware of it is just as nice as being aware of a harmonious one, but it's probably the case that the latter is more beneficial for the body, so I need to learn to pick up the new subtler cues faster. In a similar vein, I seem to be less dependent on yoga for my sense of wellbeing. That makes me less prone to do yoga as regularly. However, I still function better with yoga than without it, and yoga is still important for my health. Yet, I'm more okay with not functioning properly and with having health issues. Also, the health issues really seem to be milder too. So I need to find a drive that is less rooted in suffering. That shouldn't be so hard, because I actually love yoga, but apparently suffering was still the kick that would get me started every day. And now it's not. What a peculiar problem!",

It tasted like the first time I tasted it. It has never been quite as tasty again. I had forgotten it. The first time it came up, it seemed very random. The second time, I realized that it's associated with the scent of putting out a candle. It just hasn't popped up in such a visceral way before, but remained subconscious, I continue to have issues with forgetting my antidepressant. Today it was rather the case that I missed that specific pill from the pile of pills and supplements that I had put together before taking them. I'm so used to relying on sensations to tell me what I need to do, as my executive functioning is so weak. I'm still getting sensations, lots of them, but they have stopped feeling bad. I just noticed this amazing flow of energy, and I sat with it, not to get rid of it, but to embrace it. Then my pawo called, and as I reached out for the tablet, I saw the pill lying next to it and realized that the energy flow was actually withdrawal symptoms, and so I took the pill.

        "msg": "Log February 15th, 2023 Wu chi 15 minutes: Loud high-pitched nada sound and a sense of spaciousness. Fire kasina 25 minutes: Almost no bouncing around of the photorealistic flame image. It didn\u2019t flicker much either, but it was relatively pale. A sense of lightness and effortlessness. Some more energy needs to be put into it, without loosing that light touch. Balloon posture 10 minutes: Amazingly comfortable thanks to what I learned from the floating tank. I now use the large muscle between the shoulder blades instead of the tiny weak muscles in the shoulders. Soooo spacious. So relaxed! (Yesterday I was so relaxed in the balloon posture that I could have fallen asleep.) Smooth foamy energy feel. Fire kasina 40 minutes: Still very little bouncing, and now brighter and sharper. Pleasantly effortless with a sense of lightness. Then I got distracted for a while, albeit in a wholesome way; I got occupied with metta-like thoughts about practicioners I have become acquainted with. Then back to the task. Then I combined the task with playing with tuning into the four different formed jhanas, one at a time, over and over again. I didn\u2019t get into them for real, but I could sense the jhanic factors, and the tuning improved over time. Thanks Martin for that piece of advise (in Paul\u2019s thread)! It resonated and rang true, so I think I will continue to play with that. After a while, the piti I summoned was really strong, and it took away some pain that I\u2019d had in my back (I ran out of L-lysine a few days ago, so I\u2019m surprised I have so little pain). I was about to transform some mild lower back (side) pain to piti as well, but the bell rang and it was time to dedicate our practice. Anyway, I was okay just sitting with that pain. It didn\u2019t really differ from piti when I watched it closer. --- Note from the late afternoon/early evening when I was walking to my job, uphills in mud and in a hurry: \u201dWow. I just found myself being super contracted - and I also found that I didn\u2019t mind. How freeing! And when I rejoiced in that, the contraction dissolved into piti and then spaciousness. New contractions came, and I didn\u2019t mind, so they didn\u2019t stick.\u201d I was able to do a high-pulse training activity without getting sick thanks to ujjayi breath. They really should teach that in school! It would have saved me so much pain. I played floorball for the first time since the Swedish equivalent to highschool. I was on it like a pitbull. I suck at aiming and dribbling (and yet I actually scored two goals!) but I ace at taking the ball from others. I can see exactly when they drop their focus just a little bit, and then I strike. I think I can consider myself cured from the weird version of chronic fatigue that I used to have which made me super-sick everytime I strained myself physically even the slightest bit. The cure: yogic breathing. I\u2019m back on track with my yoga.",
